FootNotes:
1," The financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2018 are presented in accordance with the current revenue recognition accounting standard adopted on January 1, 2018.  Financial statements for all periods prior to January 1, 2018 are presented under the previous revenue recognition accounting standard.  See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information."
2, Reflects the change in the presentation of advertising expenses and sales and marketing expenses and the reclassification of certain expenses from cost of revenues to operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.  See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.
3," Includes a non-cash charge related to an impairment of OpenTable goodwill of $941 million, which is not tax deductible, for the year ended December 31, 2016 (see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements).  The goodwill impairment charge reduced the 2016 basic and diluted net income per share by $19.01 and $18.79, respectively."
4," Includes net unrealized losses on marketable equity securities of $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2018.  Pursuant to the adoption of the accounting update on financial instruments in 2018, for periods beginning after December 31, 2017, marketable equity securities are reported at estimated fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income rather than accumulated other comprehensive income within stockholders' equity.  See Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information."
