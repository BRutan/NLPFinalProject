1," Under the Company's share repurchase program, as approved by its Board of Directors on January 11, 2011, the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of its common stock, solely through open market purchases effected through a broker dealer at prevailing market prices, based on a variety of factors such as price, corporate trading policy requirements and overall market conditions not to exceed a dollar limit authorized by the Board of Directors.  The Company's Board of Directors may increase or otherwise modify, renew, suspend or terminate the share repurchase program at any time, without prior notice.  As announced on February 7, 2018, and November 13, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors each time approved a resolution to increase the authorization amount under the share repurchase program by an additional $1.0 billion, resulting in a cumulative authorization amount of $11.8 billion.  Each additional authorization is effective for a three-year period, beginning on its respective announcement date.  The authorization under the share repurchase program that currently has capacity is scheduled to expire on November 13, 2021.  No other share repurchase programs existed during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018."

1," Our Revolving Credit Facility, which has a maximum aggregate commitment of $1.20 billion and matures in April 2022, bears interest (other than swing line loans), at our option, at either the Alternate Base Rate or Adjusted LIBO Rate (both as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus a margin, that will vary from 0.000% to 0.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Alternate Base Rate and 0.680% to 1.250% in the case of loans bearing interest at the Adjusted LIBO Rate, in each case based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.  Swing line loans made under the Revolving Credit Facility bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate plus the applicable margin described above.  In addition, we pay a facility fee on the aggregate amount of the commitments in an amount equal to a percentage of such commitments, varying from 0.070% to 0.250% per annum based upon the better of the ratings assigned to our debt by Moody's Investor Service, Inc. and Standard & Poor's Rating Services, subject to limited exceptions.  Based on our current credit ratings, our margin for Alternate Base Rate loans was 0.000%, our margin for Eurodollar Revolving Loans was 0.900% and our facility fee was 0.100%.  As of December 31, 2018, we had outstanding borrowings in the amount of $287 million under our Revolving Credit Facility."
2," The minimum lease payments above do not include certain tax, insurance and maintenance costs, which are also required contractual obligations under our operating leases but are generally not fixed and can fluctuate from year to year.  These expenses historically average approximately 20% of the corresponding lease payments.  See Note 6 ""Leasing"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our operating leases."
3," We use various self-insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities from workers' compensation, vehicle and general liability, and employee health care benefits.  The self-insurance reserves above are at the undiscounted obligation amount.  The self-insurance reserves liabilities are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets at our estimate of their net present value and do not have scheduled maturities; however, we can estimate the timing of future payments based upon historical patterns.  See Note 11 ""Commitments"" to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our self-insurance reserves."
