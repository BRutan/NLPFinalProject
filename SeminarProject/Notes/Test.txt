Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state
 of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial p
ublic offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbo
l "AMZN." As used herein, "Amazon.com," "we," "our," and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subs
idiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. General We seek to be Earth's most customer-centric compan
y. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention,
 commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary
 customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition
, we provide services, such as advertising. We have organized our operations into three segments: North Amer
ica, International, and Amazon Web Services ("AWS"). These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates it
s business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item 8 of Pa
rt II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10 -- Segment Information." The financial result
s of Whole Foods Market, Inc. ("Whole Foods Market") have been included in our consolidated financial statem
ents from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Consumers We serve consumers through our online and ph
ysical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds of mil
lions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Customer
s access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. We also
 manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo devic
es, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possible th
rough low everyday product pricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so that we
 can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and reliabl
e fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program that in
cludes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of thousands of movi
es and TV episodes, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including through: N
orth America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outsourced 
arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate customer se
rvice centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, "Properties
." Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our stores
, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed fees, 
a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller program
s. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, governm
ent agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global compute
, storage, database, and other service offerings. 3 Table of Contents  Content Creators We serve authors and
 independent publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and p
ublishers choose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon's ow
n publishing arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill
 and app developers, and others to publish and sell content. Competition Our businesses encompass a large va
riety of product types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we comp
ete is evolving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many differ
ent industry sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commer
ce, and omnichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the produc
ts we offer and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, d
igital, and interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison
 shopping websites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using
, or acquiring goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies t
hat provide e-commerce services, including website development, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, 
and payment processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for 
third parties, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or prod
ucts, including on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design,
 manufacture, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. We believe th
at the principal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, inc
luding fast and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services 
include the quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers' ability and wil
lingness to change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources,
 longer histories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to ou
r various businesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue res
trictive distribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings
 instead of ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technolog
y, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and th
e development of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also 
may enter into business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual 
Property We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secr
ets, proprietary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on 
trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements
 with our employees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, 
or applied for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service mar
ks, and copyrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain 
of our proprietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, c
ertain of our proprietary rights to third parties. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, whic
h historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We rec
ognized 32% , 34% , and 31% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016 , , and 2018 . Fourth qu
arter 2017 results include revenue attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017.
 Employees We employed approximately 647,500 full-time and part-time employees as of . However, employment l
evels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contrac
tors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils, statutory employee represe
ntation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of o
ur studio operations within the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition fo
r qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, co
mputer scientists, and other technical staff. Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon
.com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly ma
ke available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the 4 Table of Conten
ts  Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), corporate governance information (including our Code of Busi
ness Conduct and Ethics), and select press releases. Executive Officers and Directors The following tables s

<subsection name: "Risk Factors;">
Please carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, fin
ancial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the
 current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. We Face Intense Competition Our businesses a
re rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, includi
ng physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices
, web and infrastructure computing services, and transportation and logistics services, and across geographi
es, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources
, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched p
roducts and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt m
ore aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.
 Competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and w
ell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established
 companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enh
anced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electr
onic devices, may increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shoppi
ng, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on
 our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are rapidly and significantly expanding our 
global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to 
support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and plac
es significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial re
sources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effecti
vely, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our 
Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Busine
ss, Legal, Financial, and Competitive Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segment
s, and our customers may not adopt our offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology c
hallenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or
 failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower 
than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our in
vestments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negat
ively affect our operating results. We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and 
Growth Rate We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and invest
ment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may no
t be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may 
not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth de
pends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our 
business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether c
aused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decre
ased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, includin
g due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following: * our ability to retain and increase s
ales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers' demands; * our ability to reta
in and expand our network of sellers; * our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, 
and fulfill orders; * the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases,
 or improvements; * changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and 
web services, including outside the U.S.; 6 Table of Contents  * timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansi
on and upgrades of our systems and infrastructure; * the success of our geographic, service, and product lin
e expansions; * the extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operati
ons and future growth; * the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetar
y damages or injunctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; * variatio
ns in the mix of products and services we sell; * variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns;
 * the extent to which we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional b
enefits to our customers; * factors affecting our reputation or brand image; * the extent to which we invest
 in technology and content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; * increases in the prices of fuel and
 gasoline, as well as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packin
g supplies; * the extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating
 items; * the extent to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully ch
arge fees to grant our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; * our ability t
o collect amounts owed to us when they become due; * the extent to which use of our services is affected by 
spyware, viruses, phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions
, outages, and similar events; and * terrorist attacks and armed hostilities. Our International Operations E
xpose Us to a Number of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and 
we plan to further expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively litt
le operating experience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is 
costly to establish, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand intern
ationally. Our international operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks des
cribed elsewhere in this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, i
ncluding: * local economic and political conditions; * government regulation (such as regulation of our prod
uct and service offerings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection me
asures, including export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions
 on foreign ownership; * restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertain
ty regarding liability for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Intern
et-friendly legal systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practice
s regarding the physical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property
 rights; * business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and
 electronic devices; * limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange
 restrictions; * limited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; * shorter payable and longer receivable 
cycles and the resultant negative impact on cash flow; * laws and regulations regarding consumer and data pr
otection, privacy, network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; * lower
 levels of use of the Internet; * lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compa
red to the U.S.; * lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; * difficulty in staffing, d
eveloping, and managing foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; 7 Ta
ble of Contents  * different employee/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor u
nions; * compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws p
rohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties; * laws and policies of the U.S.
 and other jurisdictions affecting trade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and * geopolitical events, i
ncluding war and terrorism. As international physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services
 grow, competition will intensify, including through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies m
ay have a substantial competitive advantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the loc
al customer, as well as their more established local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain,
 and manage required personnel, which may limit our international growth. The People's Republic of China ("P
RC") and India regulate Amazon's and its affiliates' businesses and operations in country through regulation
s and license requirements that may restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT inf
rastructure, data centers, retail, delivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of
 media and other products and services. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensi
ng requirements, www.amazon.cn is operated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or part
ially, by PRC nationals. In addition, we provide certain technology services in China in conjunction with th
ird parties that hold PRC licenses to provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or 
control of Indian companies by foreign entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. Fo
r www.amazon.in, we provide certain marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable 
them to sell online and deliver to customers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are t
hird-party sellers on the www.amazon.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities com
ply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC and India are actively considering changes in
 their foreign investment rules that could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial unc
ertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that thes
e governments will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses a
nd operations may be unable to continue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient f
unding or in China enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such business
es. If our international activities were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian or o
ther laws or regulations or if interpretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses 
in those countries could be subject to fines and other financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be for
ced to restructure our operations or shut down entirely. If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our 
Fulfillment Network and Data Centers, Our Business Could Be Harmed If we do not adequately predict customer 
demand or otherwise optimize and operate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could res
ult in excess or insufficient fulfillment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment 
charges, or both, or harm our business in other ways. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capa
bility or add new businesses with different requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become in
creasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be ab
le to operate our networks effectively. In addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment netw
ork will increase our net shipping cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers 
may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other busines
ses on whose behalf we perform inventory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in 
excess of forecasts, we may be unable to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our f
ulfillment network. We rely on a limited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and complet
ed orders to our customers. If we are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they ex
perience performance problems or other difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and cu
stomer experience. In addition, our ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orde
rs to customers also may be negatively affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, 
labor disputes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, and similar factors. Under some of our commercial agr
eements, we maintain the inventory of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking invento
ry and operating our fulfillment network. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of 
these other companies to accurately forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm 
to our business and reputation. 8 Table of Contents  The Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain
 on Our Operations We expect a disproportionate amount of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. 
If we do not stock or restock popular products in sufficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer dema
nd, it could significantly affect our revenue and our future growth. If we overstock products, we may be req
uired to take significant inventory markdowns or write-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce p
rofitability. We may experience an increase in our net shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-sh
ipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessary to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If t
oo many customers access our websites within a short period of time due to increased demand, we may experien
ce system interruptions that make our websites unavailable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders,
 which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. In additi
on, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfillment network and customer service centers during these p
eak periods and delivery and other fulfillment companies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to m
eet the seasonal demand. We also face risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment netw
ork optimization and inventory. We generally have payment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond t
he amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, a
s of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances typically reac
h their highest level (other than as a result of cash flows provided by or used in investing and financing a
ctivities). This operating cycle results in a corresponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. 
Our accounts payable balance generally declines during the first three months of the year, resulting in a co
rresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances. Our Business Could Su
ffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Allianc
es, and Other Business Relationships We provide physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other servi
ces to businesses through commercial agreements, strategic alliances, and business relationships. Under thes
e agreements, we provide web services, technology, fulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other servic
es, as well as enable sellers to offer products or services through our stores. These arrangements are compl
ex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, personnel, and other resource commitments, which may lim
it the amount of business we can service. We may not be able to implement, maintain, and develop the compone
nts of these commercial relationships, which may include web services, fulfillment, customer service, invent
ory management, tax collection, payment processing, hardware, content, and third-party software, and engagin
g third parties to perform services. The amount of compensation we receive under certain of our commercial a
greements is partially dependent on the volume of the other company's sales. Therefore, if the other company
's offerings are not successful, the compensation we receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may
 be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to enter into additional commercial relationships and strategic
 alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subject to claims from businesses to which we provide these se
rvices if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maintaining, or developing these services. As our agreements 
terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace these agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in t
he future enter into amendments on less favorable terms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting th
eir contractual obligations to us, which could adversely affect our operating results. Our present and futur
e e-commerce services agreements, other commercial agreements, and strategic alliances create additional ris
ks such as: * disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses;
 * impairment of other relationships; * variability in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or t
erminating such agreements or relationships; and * difficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. O
ur Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Inv
estments We have acquired and invested in a number of companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter in
to joint ventures with additional companies. These transactions (such as our acquisition of Whole Foods Mark
et, Inc.) create risks such as: * disruption of our ongoing business, including loss of management focus on 
existing businesses; * problems retaining key personnel; * additional operating losses and expenses of the b
usinesses we acquired or in which we invested; * the potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions; 9 Table of Contents  * the potential impairment of cust
omer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we invested or our own customers as a re
sult of any integration of operations; * the difficulty of completing such transactions and achieving antici
pated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all; * the difficulty of incorporating acquired operations,
 technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expenses related to such integration; * the di
fficulty of integrating a new company's accounting, financial reporting, management, information and informa
tion security, human resource, and other administrative systems to permit effective management, and the lack
 of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented; * for investments in which an investee's fina
ncial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either in full or in part, the dependence on t
he investee's accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, controls, and processes; * the difficult
y of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, and policies appropriate for a larger pu
blic company; * the risks associated with businesses we acquire or invest in, which may differ from or be mo
re significant than the risks our other businesses face; * potential unknown liabilities associated with a c
ompany we acquire or in which we invest; and * for foreign transactions, additional risks related to the int
egration of operations across different cultures and languages, and the economic, political, and regulatory 
risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acquisitions or mergers, we might need to is
sue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, contingent liabilities, or amortization exp
enses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our profitability and harm our business or onl
y be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuations supporting our acquisitions and stra
tegic investments could change rapidly given the current global economic climate. We could determine that su
ch valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary declines in fair value which could advers
ely impact our financial results. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The results of operations of, and certain of
 our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores and product and service offerings are e
xposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from
 expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. 
As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations has increased. 
We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign currencies including British Pounds, E
uros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to these currencies, cash equivalents, and m
arketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially less than expected and vice versa. The Los
s of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retain Highly Skilled and Other Key Personne
l Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior management and other key personnel, particula
rly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not have "key person" life insurance policies.
 We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qualified personnel in the technology indus
try has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, computer scientists, and other techn
ical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees or the inability to hire, train
, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. We Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other 
Security Breaches Because we process, store, and transmit large amounts of data, including personal informat
ion, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors'
 or customers' technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such 
information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us, det
er customers or sellers from using our stores and services, and otherwise harm our business and reputation. 
We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, including, without limitation, encryptio
n and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to customers, back-office support, and oth
er functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security breaches, and, although they did not have a
 material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no assurance of a similar result in the futu
re. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to protect customer information and p
revent data loss and other security breaches, including 10 Table of Contents  systems and processes designed
 to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such measures cannot provide
 absolute security. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundancy We experience occasi
onal system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable or slow to respond and 
prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, which may reduce our n
et sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to continually add software a
nd hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take other steps to improve the
 efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversely affect our operating
 results. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or interrupted by fire, fl
ood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, acts of God, computer vi
ruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of these events could cause 
system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from accepting and fulfilling c
ustomer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offerings less attractive an
d subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recovery planning may not be
 sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for any related losses. An
y of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. We Face Significant Inventory Risk
 In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network and inventory opti
mization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that may adversely affect ou
r operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in product cycles and pr
icing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes in consumer
 tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accurately predict these t
rends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Demand for products, howe
ver, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and the date of sale. In 
addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to establish vendor rela
tionships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisi
tion of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they m
ay not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of certain products, such 
as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities or during the releva
nt selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversely affect our operating
 results. We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or May Be Accused of Inf
ringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, p
atents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual property as critical to
 our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protection, and confidential
ity and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our proprietary rights. E
ffective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and se
rvices are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all co
untries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may not protect our tradema
rks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names th
at are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary rights. We m
ay not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our proprietary rights. Third 
parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the value of our proprietary
 rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the expenditure of significan
t financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may n
ot adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietar
y rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivale
nt or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. Other parties also may claim that we infrin
ge their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be subject to, claims and le
gal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property rights of third parties. S
uch claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial and manageria
l resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy indemnification obligat
ions. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infringed their rights, but 
such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, we may not be able to o
btain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other rights with respect to inte
llectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole
 or primary business is to assert such claims. 11 Table of Contents  Our digital content offerings depend in
 part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the digital
 rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject to c
laims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have a Rapidly Evo
lving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. The t
rading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks descr
ibed elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: * changes in interest rates; * conditions or trends in the Inter
net and the industry segments we operate in; * quarterly variations in operating results; * fluctuations in 
the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; * changes in fin
ancial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts; * changes in our c
apital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; * changes in the valuation 
methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and * transactions in our commo
n stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock price
 could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compensat
ion to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating resu
lts or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Government Regulation Is Evolv
ing and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and laws,
 as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel 
retail, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our grow
th. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, d
istribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energ
y consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consume
r protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online payment se
rvices, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to our fa
cilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics, legali
ty, and quality of products and services, product labeling, and the commercial operation of unmanned aircraf
t systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, data protec
tion, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, and artificial 
intelligence technologies and services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesses, i
ncluding certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisions interpreting o
r applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products and se
rvices and increase our cost of doing business. We Could Be Subject to Additional Tax Liabilities and Collec
tion Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federal an
d state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to addit
ional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws, re
gulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to th
e global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such chan
ges could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of juris
dictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, incl
uding revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These inc
lude new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces and r
emote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For example, 
the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online adve
rtising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely effect
ed by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the fail
ure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, supplie
rs, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we also
 may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply by the 
effective date. 12 Table of Contents  Our tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors,
 such as changes in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geogra
phies, intercompany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdicti
ons for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, cha
nges in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our deferred tax assets 
and liabilities and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax e
xpense and liabilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations
 for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as the U.S. Tax C
uts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the "U.S. Tax Act") requires complex computations to be performed that were not pr
eviously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of t
he U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not 
previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting
 bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied o
r otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have prev
iously recorded that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments a
re made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdiction
s may assess additional tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax co
ntroversy could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for w
hich that development occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihoo
d of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Alth
ough we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other
 tax controversies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. Our Supplier Relationship
s Subject Us to a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, lim
ited or single-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any relat
ed ongoing servicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our supp
liers to guarantee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, 
or the extension of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, c
ontent, components, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one o
r more supplier bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other
 reasons, we may be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and
 on acceptable terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, reg
ulations, our code of standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, 
or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our
 operating results. We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regul
ations Our contracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to var
ious procurement regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and perform
ance. We may be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violation
s could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination o
f contract, refunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or 
debarment from future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the go
vernment at any time, without cause. We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are
 Harmed by the Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to 
product liability or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or p
roperty damage, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products u
sing our services and stores that may increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these se
llers do not have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we canno
t be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will con
tinue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements
 with our vendors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. We Are Subject to Payments-Related
 Risks We accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (in
cluding promotional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer's bank account, consumer invoicing,
 physical bank check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our cus
tomers, we may become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations t
o implement enhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of 
use of our payments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods, 13 Table of Contents  includin
g credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our oper
ating costs and lower profitability. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment meth
ods and payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic check
s, and promotional financing. In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwillin
g or unable to provide these services to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adve
rsely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating 
rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds trans
fers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail
 to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached, compromised, or o
therwise unable to detect or prevent fraudulent activity, we may be liable for card issuing banks' costs, su
bject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments fr
om our customers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our 
business and operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we provide regulated services in ce
rtain jurisdictions because we enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third
 parties, and because we provide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these 
jurisdictions, we may be subject to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital m
aintenance, the use, handling, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or pr
ocessing data, and authentication. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws 
and regulations relating to payments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and informati
on security, and electronic fund transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regula
tions, we could be subject to additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease p
roviding certain services. We Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relat
ing to the liability of online service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies 
could require changes in the way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we may be unable to 
prevent sellers from collecting payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products 
they ordered or when the products received are materially different from the sellers' descriptions. We also 
may be unable to prevent sellers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, p
irated, or stolen goods, selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights 
of others, or otherwise violating our policies. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up
 to certain limits in these situations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program w
ill increase and could negatively affect our operating results. In addition, to the extent any of this occur
s, it could harm our business or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unl
awful activities by our sellers.

Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the me
aning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of histo
rical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or 
financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as antici
pates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. F
orward-looking statements reflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual res
ults could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exch
ange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of
 the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business oppor
tunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of
 net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes
, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and e
xpansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center op
timization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and dev
elop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, 
and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate ampli
fies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could
 cause our actual results to differ significantly from management's expectations, are described in greater d
etail in Item 1A of Part I, "Risk Factors." Overview . The products offered through our stores include merch
andise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also man
ufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inve
ntory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as servic
e sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numer
ous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfi
llment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising. Free cash flows are driven primarily by 
increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2 and cash capital expenditures, includ
ing our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily result
 from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially of
fset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and services
, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving availab
ility, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories a
nd service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and earni
ng customer trust. Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related tran
saction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service suppo
rt, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs nece
ssary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online stor
es, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment cente
rs and other facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs gener
ally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other fact
ors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we seek
 to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes. To
 minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.       
_______________________ (1) See "Results of Operations -- Non-GAAP Financial Measures" below for additional 
information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. (2) Working capital consists of accounts rec
eivable, inventory, and accounts payable. 18 Table of Contents  On average, our high inventory velocity mean
s we generally collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in in
ventory turnover over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of s
ales by us and by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection
 of product offerings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choos
e to utilize third-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days ove
r time since they are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by t
hird-party sellers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the
 effect of balancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers. We believe that advances in technol
ogy, specifically the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, 
will continue to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people's lives
. To best take advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build
 and deploy innovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which of
fers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterpr
ises of all sizes. We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because 
we believe this compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In meas
uring shareholder dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to e
stimated forfeitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were 504 million and 507 millio
n as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to cu
rrencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher th
an if currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to 
currencies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower t
han if currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. econ
omy through our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also belie
ve it is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency c
hanges. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and loss
es associated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may con
tinue, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidate
d trends and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 o
f Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 1 -- Description of Business and Accounting 
Policies."                _______________________ (3) The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in 
inventory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 19 Table of C
ontents  Critical Accounting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles of the United States ("GAAP") requires estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent
 liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company'
s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company's financi
al condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subject
ive judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Bas
ed on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We
 also have other key accounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions tha
t are significant to understanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, "Financia
l Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 1 -- Description of Business and Accounting Policies." Although 
we believe that our estimates, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information pr
esently available. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions,
 judgments, or conditions. Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted f
or using the first-in first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This v
aluation requires us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of
 disposition, such as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, an
d expected recoverable values of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of in
ventory are inherently uncertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize materi
al write-downs in the future. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation al
lowance as of , we would have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $190 million. In additio
n, we enter into supplier commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These c
ommitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional 
costs. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Ta
x laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may 
be subject to significant change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, 
and significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes
. There are many transactions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax d
etermination is uncertain. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in
 our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany
 transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated 
in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we h
ave higher statutory rates, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related ta
x benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in
 our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the law
s, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes 
to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In a
ddition, a number of countries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multi
nationals, such as the U.S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 
(the "U.S. Tax Act"). Finally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that c
ould result in further changes to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results o
f operations. The U.S. Tax Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requi
res complex computations to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judg
ments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculati
ons, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S.
 Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidanc
e on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is iss
ued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our prov
ision for income taxes in the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax
 controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilitie
s against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect
 on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well 
as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from
 these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are 
reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially
 different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. 20 Table of Contents  See Item 8 of Part 
II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 1 -- Description of Business and Accounting Policie
s." Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our c
onsolidated statements of cash flows as described in Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplement
ary Data -- Note 1 -- Description of Business and Accounting Policies," is as follows (in millions):    Year
 Ended December 31,  2016  2017  2018 Cash provided by (used in):      Operating activities $ 17,203   $ 18,
365   $ 30,723  Investing activities (9,516 )  (27,084 )  (12,369 ) Financing activities (3,716 )  9,928   (
7,686 ) Our principal sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equiv
alents, and marketable securities balances, which, at fair value, were $ 26.0 billion , $31.0 billion , and 
$41.3 billion as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were $9.1 billi
on , $11.1 billion , and $13.8 billion , as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and were primarily Euro
s, British Pounds, and Japanese Yen. Cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $17.2 billion , $18
.4 billion , and $30.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from ca
sh received from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers
, offset by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and r
elated transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash receive
d from our customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primaril
y use credit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The increase in operating 
cash flow in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to the increase in net
 income, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash p
rovided by (used in) operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at 
any specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and cat
egory expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign
 exchange rates. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures,
 including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for
 acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and ma
turities of marketable securities. Cash provided by (used in) investing activities was $(9.5) billion , $(27
.1) billion , and $(12.4) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , with the variability caused primarily by cash 
paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, maturities, 
and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $ 6.7 billion , $ 10.1 billion , and $11.
3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , which primarily reflect additional capacity to support our fulfillment
 operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology infrastructure 
(the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three years. In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we made cash 
payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of $116 million , $14.0
 billion , and $2.2 billion . Cash provided by (used in) financing activities was $(3.7) billion , $9.9 bill
ion , and $(7.7) billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Cash outflows from financing activities result from pri
ncipal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases and repayments of long-term de
bt and other, which were $4.3 billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.5 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Property
 and equipment acquired under capital leases was $5.7 billion , $9.6 billion , and $10.6 billion in 2016 , 2
017 , and 2018 , with the increase reflecting investments in support of continued business growth primarily 
due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which investments we expect to continue over time. 
Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from proceeds from long-term debt and other. Proceed
s from long-term debt and other were $618 million , $16.2 billion , and $768 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 20
18 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance o
f $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranches maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from
 notes issued in August 2017 (the "August 2017 Notes") were used to fund the consideration for the acquisiti
on of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. 21 Table of Conten
ts  In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the "Commercial Paper Program") under which we
 may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with indi
vidual maturities that may vary but will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowing
s outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 . We had no borrowings outstanding 
under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") and $594 million of borrowings outsta
nding under our $620 million secured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Facility") as of December 31, 20
18 . See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 5 -- Debt" for additional i
nformation. In 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , we recorded net tax provisions of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and 
$1.2 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, whic
h also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substanti
ally all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitel
y outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repa
triation of such amounts. As of December 31, 2018 , cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities held b
y foreign subsidiaries was $12.0 billion. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation d
eductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income.
 The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing 
full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) we
re $412 million , $957 million , and $1.2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 , our
 federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billio
n of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are
 primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operat
ing losses and tax credits we expect cash paid for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes
 on a cash basis, rather than on a financial reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission's O
ctober 2017 decision against us on state aid, Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount
, consistent with the European Commission's decision, of approximately EUR250 million, that we deposited int
o escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. Our liquidity is also affec
ted by restricted cash balances that are pledged as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-
party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we proc
ess payments for third-party sellers or offer certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdict
ions may restrict our use of those funds. These restrictions would result in the reclassification of a porti
on of our cash and cash equivalents from "Cash and cash equivalents" to restricted cash, which is classified
 within "Accounts receivable, net and other" on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2017 and
 2018 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities were $1.3 billion and $426 million . Se
e Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 7 -- Commitments and Contingencies
" for additional discussion of our principal contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additio
nally, purchase obligations and open purchase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory 
commitments, were $13.1 billion as of December 31, 2018 . These purchase obligations and open purchase order
s are generally cancellable in full or in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flow
s generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as o
ur borrowing arrangements, will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the 
next 12 months. However, any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial unce
rtainty. See Item 1A of Part I, "Risk Factors." We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equ
ity or debt securities, obtain credit facilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements,
 repurchase common stock, pay dividends, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for str
ategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position. The sale of additional equity or convertible
 debt securities would likely be dilutive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, cons
ider the acquisition of, or investment in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastruct
ure, and technologies, which might affect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financ
ing, or issue additional equity or debt securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines o
r financing instruments will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  22 Table of C
ontents  Results of Operations We have organized our operations into three segments: North America, Internat
ional, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Whole Foods Market from the date of acquisition in Aug
ust 2017. These segments reflect the way the Company evaluates its business performance and manages its oper
ations. See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 10 -- Segment Informatio
n." Net sales include product and service sales. Product sales represent revenue from the sale of products a
nd related shipping fees and digital media content where we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily re
present third-party seller fees, which includes commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, A
WS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising services, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net

sion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see "Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates" below. 
North America sales increased  33% in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales grow
th in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and the imp
act of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued effo
rts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory ava
ilability, and increased selection. International sales increased  23% and 21% in 2017 , and 2018 , compared
 to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, inclu
ding sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our continued efforts to redu
ce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stock inventory availability, 
and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted International net sales by $(48
9) million , $138 million , and $1.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . AWS sales increased  43 % and 47 % 
in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects 
increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Pricing changes were driven largely by our co
ntinued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 23 Table of Contents   Operating income (loss) by segmen
t is as follows (in millions):  Year Ended December 31,  2016  2017  2018 Operating Income (Loss):      Nort

lion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than 
gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services. The increase in N
orth America operating income in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years,
 is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and sl
ower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Chan
ges in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $27 million , $(4) million , and $17 million for 
2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The decrease in International operating loss in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 ,
 compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-
party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs
 to expand our fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by $89 million
 , $(85) million , and $258 million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The increase in AWS operating income in abs
olute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased custo
mer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on tec
hnology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investment
s to support the business growth. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $(5) millio
n , $(53) million , and $(49) million for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 24 Table of Contents  Information about o

 of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, incl
uding video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and i
nbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. The increase
 in cost of sales in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primaril
y due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. Shipping costs to receive prod
ucts from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products 
to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and transportation costs, wer
e $16.2 billion , $21.7 billion , and $27.7 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We expect our cost of shippi
ng to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipping offers at an increasing r
ate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we offer additional services. We 
seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher sales volumes, optimizing our 
fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving better operating efficiencie
s. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our future success, and one way we
 offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segment are primarily classified as
 "Technology and content" as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports both our internal technology 
requirements and external sales to AWS customers. 25 Table of Contents  Fulfillment costs primarily consist 
of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment centers, c
ustomer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment processing and 
related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as "Technology and
 content." Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such as payment p
rocessing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volume, size, an
d weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expansion, the ex
tent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold, and our a
bility to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operations and enhan
cements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfillment cost
s associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transactions, and 
payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sales versus 
our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. The increase
 in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is prim
arily due to costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores, and variable cost
s corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels. We seek to expand our 
fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to meet anticipated
 shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which we provide the 
fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. We direct customers to our stores pri
marily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search, third party cus
tomer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiatives. Our marketing
 costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent there is increased
 or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these channels shifts, we w
ould expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The increase in marketing costs in absolut
e dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to payroll and related
 expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, as well as increased spending on online
 marketing channels. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shipping offers are not 
included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing tools, and intend to co
ntinue offering them indefinitely. Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for emp
loyees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and services, development, desi
gn, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made available in our onlin
e stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data cen
ter related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon busi
nesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of produc
ts and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of technology and content 
so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficiency through rapid techn
ology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and content investment and c
apital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due to geographic expansio
n and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in technology and content to
 increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. These costs are allocated
 to segments based on usage. The increase in technology and content costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 20
18 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to an increase in spending on technology infra
structure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams responsible for expanding 
our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and service offerings. The incr
ease in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in 2017 and 2018 , compared to the comparable p
rior years, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. 26 Table of Contents  Other opera
ting expense, net was $167 million , $214 million , and $296 million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , and is 
primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. Our interest income was $100 million , $202 mill
ion , and $440 million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated mone
y market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Our interest income
 corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing rates, which vary depending 
on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense was $484 million , $848 milli
on , and $1.4 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The increase is primarily due to increases in our long-ter
m debt and capital and finance lease arrangements. Our long-term debt was $24.7 billion and $23.5 billion as
 of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Our other long-term liabilities were $21.0 billion and $27.2 billion as of 
December 31, 2017 and 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 5 -
- Debt and Note 6 -- Other Long-Term Liabilities" for additional information. Other income (expense), net wa
s $90 million , $346 million , and $(183) million during 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The primary components of 
other income (expense), net are related to foreign currency, equity warrant valuation, and equity securities
 gains. Our effective tax rate is subject to significant variation due to several factors, including variabi
lity in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and the mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercomp
any transactions, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, inv
estments, audit-related developments, changes in our stock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and lia
bilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, a
nd administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global
 tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative chan
ges of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are not recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate ca
n be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discret
e items and non-deductible expenses on our effective tax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower. T
he U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. co
rporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, elimin
ating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries,
 introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act al
so enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing 
of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Ta
x Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a pr
ovisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was prim
arily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent re
duction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory on
e-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not 
material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act. We rec
orded a provision for income taxes of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 20
18 . Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from
 stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an incr
ease in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related develo
pments. We have recorded valuation allowances against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for whi
ch we may not realize a related tax benefit. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we 
will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this ass
essment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative los
s experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the ca
rry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we r
ecognized an estimated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net
 deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily
 due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act reco
gnized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to the 27 Table of Contents  U.S. federal statuto
ry tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefi
t, and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. We have tax benefits relating to ex
cess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to 
reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of December 31, 2018 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was ap
proximately $627 million and we had approximately $1.4 billion of federal tax credits potentially available 
to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal research
 and development credit. See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 9 -- In
come Taxes" for additional information. Equity-method investment activity, net of tax, was $(96) million , $
(4) million , and $9 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The primary components of this activity during 2016
 , 2017 , and 2018 were our equity-method investment gains (losses) during the years and impairments recorde
d in 2016. Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and 
other SEC regulations define and prescribe the conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information.
 Our measures of free cash flows and the effect of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of 
operations meet the definition of non-GAAP financial measures. We provide multiple measures of free cash flo
ws because we believe these measures provide additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and 
equipment with cash and through capital and finance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting gu
idance, we retrospectively adjusted our consolidated statements of cash flows to add restricted cash to cash
 and cash equivalents. See Item 8 of Part II, "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data -- Note 1 -- Desc
ription of Business and Accounting Policies." Free cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by "Purcha
ses of property and equipment, net of proceeds from property and equipment incentives," which both are inclu
ded in cash flow from investing activities. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most 
comparable GAAP cash flow measure, "Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities," for 2016 , 2017 , 
and 2018 (in millions):  Year Ended December 31,  2016  2017  2018 Net cash provided by (used in) operating 
activities $ 17,203   $ 18,365   $ 30,723  Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds from propert

s lease principal repayments is free cash flow reduced by "Principal repayments of capital lease obligations
," and "Principal repayments of finance lease obligations," which are included in cash flow from financing a

apital and finance leases. The following is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repaymen

 assets acquired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by "Principal repayments of finance lease ob
ligations," which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired un
der capital leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if
 these assets had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The foll
owing is a reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired unde
r capital leases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, "Net cash provided by (used in) operating ac
tivities," for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 (in millions):  Year Ended December 31,  2016  2017  2018 Net cash pro

 (7,686 ) All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain components of the over
all cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures
. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of payments representing pri
ncipal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our mix of property and 
equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefore, we believe it i
s important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolidated statements of c
ash flows. 29 Table of Contents  Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S.

<subsection name: "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk;">
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and ch
anges in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosu
res about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, "Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources." Interest Rate Risk Our ex
posure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our lo
ng-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impa
ct our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixe
d rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates 
of interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketa
ble fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair val
ue on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds a
nd investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have th
eir fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in princi
pal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The fo
llowing table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, includ
ing principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of (in mill

2, 2057 $ 2,250  Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was $2
5.0 billion as of . Foreign Exchange Risk During , net sales from our International segment accounted for 28
% of our consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused st
ores, including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily de
nominated in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Poun
ds, and Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with
, our internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consoli
dation, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from exp
ectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For 
example, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effe
ct the prior year, International segment net sales increased by $1.3 billion in comparison with the prior ye
ar. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable secu
rities ("foreign funds"). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of December 31, 2018 , of $13.8 billion ,
 an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $690 
million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion. All cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are clas
sified as "available-for-sale." Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in "Accumulated other comprehensive 
loss," a separate component of stockholders' equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values
 are included in "Marketable securities" on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value w
ith changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances den
ominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of December 31, 2018 , an assu
med 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $305 million
, and $685 million, recorded to "Other income (expense), net." See Item 7 of Part II, "Management's Discussi
on and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Results of Operations -- Effect of Forei
gn Exchange Rates" for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchan
ge rates. 32 Table of Contents  Investment Risk As of , our recorded value in equity and equity warrant inve
stments in public and private companies was $942 million. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publi
cly traded companies represent $518 million of our investments as of December 31, 2018 , and are recorded at
 fair value, which is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity
 investments in private companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment ex
ists, we estimate the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we wr
ite down the investment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and tren
ds, recent sales/acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current glo
bal economic climate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more co
mplex due to the lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are no
t practicable. 33 Table of Contents

counting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on the Financial Statements W
e have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of December
 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholde
rs' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 and the related
 notes (collectively referred to as the "consolidated financial statements"). In our opinion, the consolidat
ed financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at D
ecember 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years
 in the period ended December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. W
e also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (Unit
ed States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 , based 
on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Or
ganizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an u
nqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Compa
ny's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on 
our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent wit
h respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and re
gulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance wit
h the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonabl
e assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error o
r fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the finan
cial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such 
procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financ
ial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates
 made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe 
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.   /s/ Ernst & Young LLP  We have served as the C

able of Contents  AMAZON.COM, INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1 -- DESCRIPTION OF BUSI
NESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Description of Business We seek to be Earth's most customer-centric company. In
 each of our segments, we serve our primary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, ent
erprises, and content creators. We serve consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selec
tion, price, and convenience. We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and
 fulfill orders through us, and programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers
, and others to publish and sell content. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS s
egment, which offers a broad set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also 
manufacture and sell electronic devices. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising. We have orga
nized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. See "Note 10 -- Segment Inf
ormation." Prior Period Reclassifications Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to 
the current period presentation, including the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on o
ur consolidated statements of cash flows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. Principles 
of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-
owned subsidiaries, and those entities in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary 
beneficiary, including certain entities in India and China and that support our seller lending financing act
ivities (collectively, the "Company"). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities 
are eliminated. The financial results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. ("Whole Foods Market") have been included 
in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Use of Estimates T
he preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affec
t the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of continge
nt liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but 
not limited to, income taxes, commitments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill,
 stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could di
ffer materially from those estimates. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our we
ighted-average outstanding common shares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-averag
e outstanding common shares including the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury s
tock method. In periods when we have a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings 
per share as their inclusion would have an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of
 diluted shares (in millions):   Year Ended December 31,  2016  2017  2018 Shares used in computation of bas
ic earnings per share 474   480   487  Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 10   13   13  Share
s used in computation of diluted earnings per share 484   493   500  41 Table of Contents  Revenue Revenue i
s measured based on the amount of consideration that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return a
llowances, promotional discounts, and rebates. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of thir
d parties, including sales and indirect taxes. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligation
s, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling 
price. We generally determine stand-alone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using e
xpected cost plus a margin. A description of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows: - We
 offer consumer products through our online and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the g
oods is transferred to the customer, which generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, i
n the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their pro
ducts in our stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. T
he commissions and any related fulfillment and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized 
when the services are rendered, which generally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-part
y carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the customer. - Our subscription sales include fees asso
ciated with Amazon Prime memberships and access to content including audiobooks, digital video, e-books, dig
ital music, and other non-AWS subscription services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to 
an evolving suite of benefits that represent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at 
the time of or in advance of delivering the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the 
subscription period. - Our AWS arrangements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other se
rvices. Revenue is allocated to services using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when t
he customer uses these services, based on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capa
city delivered on-demand. Certain services, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quan
tity over a specified term, for which revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection 
with contracts that exceed one year are capitalized and amortized over the contract term. - Other revenue pr
imarily includes sales of advertising services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the numbe
r of clicks or impressions. Return Allowances Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are
 estimated using historical experience. Liabilities for return allowances are included in "Accrued expenses 
and other" and were $567 million , $468 million , and $623 million as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018
 . Additions to the allowance were $1.5 billion , $1.8 billion , and $2.3 billion and deductions from the al
lowance were $1.5 billion , $1.9 billion , and $2.3 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Included in "Invento
ries" on our consolidated balance sheets are assets totaling $411 million , $406 million , and $519 million 
as of December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 , for the rights to recover products from customers associated wit
h our liabilities for return allowances. Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase pric
e of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music
, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound s
hipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive product
s from our suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to
 our customers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller tra
nsactions, are classified in "Fulfillment" on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements W
e have agreements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions,
 incentives, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction
 of the prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a 
reduction of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typi
cally depend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresh
olds using past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we r
ecord a portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. 42 Table of Contents  Fulf
illment Fulfillment costs primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North Amer
ica and International segments' fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores, includin
g costs attributable to buying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and 
preparing customer orders for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs as
sociated with our guarantee for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and sup
ply chain management for our manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to
 third parties that assist us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Marketing Marketing costs prim
arily consist of targeted online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketin
g and selling activities, and television advertising. We pay commissions to third parties when their custome
r referrals result in sales. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our
 vendors, and other third parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and servic
es are expensed as incurred and were $5.0 billion , $6.3 billion , and $8.2 billion in 2016 , 2017 , and 201
8 . Prepaid advertising costs were not significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Technology and Content
 Technology and content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research an
d development of new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores,
 curation and display of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs
. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, ut
ilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs 
reflect the investments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. 
Technology and content costs are generally expensed as incurred. General and Administrative General and admi
nistrative expenses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, su
ch as depreciation expense and rent; professional fees and litigation costs; and other general corporate cos
ts for corporate functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources, among others. St
ock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on 
the date of grant and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determ
ined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognize
d as expense over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estima
ted number of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or 
updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustmen
t in the period estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, includ
ing historical forfeiture experience and employee level. Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expens
e, net, consists primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amort
ization expense, and expenses related to legal settlements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expens
e), net, consists primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of $21 million , $247 million , and $(206) mi
llion in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 and equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of $67 million , $109 million , 
and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 and equity securities gains of $1 million , $18 million , and $
145 million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 43 Table of Contents  Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. 
(federal and state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxati
on under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings
. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our fo
reign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur signific
ant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of
 temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are st
ated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax a
ssets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe the
y will not be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our 
deferred tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, ca
pital gains and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting
 purposes, and other relevant factors. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain
 income tax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by
 determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be s
ustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to me
asure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate se
ttlement. We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which 
may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest 
and penalties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fa
ir value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in 
an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of
 fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to meas
ure fair value: Level 1 -- Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active 
markets. Level 2 -- Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such
 as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or simil
ar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corr
oborated by observable market data. Level 3 -- Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own as
sumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuati
ons require significant judgment. For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the f
air value of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical
 assets or liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securit
ies in inactive markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs
 derived from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash equivalents, or mark
etable securities categorized as Level 3 assets as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As part of entering into 
commercial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other c
ompanies. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , these warrants had a fair value of $441 million and $440 millio
n , and are recorded within "Other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. The related gain (loss) recor
ded in "Other income (expense), net" was $67 million , $109 million , and $(131) million in 2016 , 2017 , an
d 2018 . These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We classify all 
highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inventories
 Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in, fir
st-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to m
ake judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as thr
ough sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable va
lues of each disposition category. We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with certain of o
ur sellers' programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whether fulfi
llment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included in our in
ventories. 44 Table of Contents  We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers a
nd use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal 
course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter in
to agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion 
of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitm
ents. These commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incu
r additional costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole
 Foods Market stores. Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in "Accounts receivable, net and other" on
 our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of Dec
ember 31, 2017 and 2018 , customer receivables, net, were $6.4 billion and $9.4 billion , vendor receivables
, net, were $2.6 billion and $3.2 billion , and seller receivables, net, were $692 million and $710 million 
. Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides fund
ing to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled acc
ounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off when
 it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of the 
agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $237 million , $348 million , and $495 million as of Dece
mber 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Additions to the allowance were $451 million , $626 million , and $878 mil
lion , and deductions to the allowance were $403 million , $515 million , and $731 million in 2016 , 2017 , 
and 2018 . Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to products to be sold, le
ased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs cap
italized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related to design or
 maintenance, are expensed as incurred. Property and Equipment, Net Property and equipment are stated at cos
t less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded
 as a reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along with property we have 
acquired under build-to-suit, finance, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such as ser
vers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation is recorded on
 a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets (generally the lesser of 40 years or th
e remaining life of the underlying building, three years for our servers, five years for networking equipmen
t, ten years for heavy equipment, and three to seven years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation ex
pense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categories on our consolidated statements of 
operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations We categorize leases at their inception as either operat
ing or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receive rent holidays and other incentives
 provided by the landlord. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line basis without regard to deferred paym
ent terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of required payments. Additionally, incen
tives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term of the agreement. Leasehold improveme
nts are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expected useful life or the non-cancellab
le term of the lease. We establish assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred unde
r build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the construction of structural improveme
nts or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occupancy of facilities under build-to-
suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback acc
ounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities are accounted for as finance leases.
 We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated future costs to retire long-lived as
sets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are depreciated over the lease period into ope
rating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future value of the estimated retirement co
sts. As disclosed in "Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted," our accounting for build-to-suit and finan
ce leases will change on January 1, 2019. 45 Table of Contents  Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment
 annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate the carrying value m
ay not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a qualitative assessment 
to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carr
ying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more likely than not, we pe
rform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impairment test by firs
t comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the fair value is dete
rmined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that g
oodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the difference betwee
n the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value of the reporting u
nits using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future ne
t sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, market segment shar
e, and general economic conditions. We completed the required annual testing of goodwill for impairment for 
all reporting units as of April 1, 2018 , and determined that goodwill is no t impaired as the fair value of
 our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that caused us to update 
our annual impairment test. See "Note 4 -- Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangible Assets." Other As
sets Included in "Other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to acquired
 intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; video and music content, net of accumulated amortizatio
n; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities restricted for longer th
an one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarantees and debt related
 to our international operations; and equity warrant assets. Video and Music Content We obtain video and mus
ic content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensing provisions, which 
include both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific movie, television, or
 music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available for streaming, we recogniz
e an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We relieve the liability
 as payments are made and we amortize the asset to "Cost of sales" on a straight-line basis or on an acceler
ated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges from one to five years. If we are unab
le to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and licensing costs are expe
nsed as incurred. We also develop original content. Capitalized production costs associated with our origina
l content are limited by the amount of revenue we expect to earn, which results in a portion being expensed 
as incurred. These capitalized costs are amortized to "Cost of sales" on an accelerated basis that follows t
he viewing pattern of customer streams in the first months after availability. Investments We generally inve
st our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed in
come securities. Such investments are included in "Cash and cash equivalents" or "Marketable securities" on 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classified as available-for-sal
e and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in "Accumulated other comprehensive l
oss." Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if the investment gives us 
the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Equity-method investments 
are included within "Other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of the earnings or losses a
s reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and related gains or losses, if an
y, are classified as "Equity method investment activity, net of tax" on our consolidated statements of opera
tions. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which we do not have the ability 
to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price
s or impairments and are classified as "Other assets" on our consolidated balance sheets. Equity investments
 that have readily determinable fair values are included in "Marketable securities" on our consolidated bala
nce sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in "Other income (expense), net" on our consol
idated statement of operations. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair values of our investments 
indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity method investments, we also evaluate whether declines in
 fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. This evaluation consists of 
several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration of the unrealized loss as w
ell as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery occurs. Additionally, we 46
 Table of Contents  assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not we will 
be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered include: 
quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recent transact
ions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly available i
nformation that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in value; and 
our strategy and intentions for holding the investment. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other than good
will, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amo
unt of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment inclu
de a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or m
anner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that the carryi
ng amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in operations, i
mpairment losses are only recorded if the asset's carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounte
d, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference between th
e carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain crit
eria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is available fo
r sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date. Assets he
ld for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sale were no
t significant as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accrued Expenses and Other Included in "Accrued expenses an
d other" on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and asset retirement
 obligations, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, current debt, acqui
red digital media content, and other operating expenses. As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our liabilities 
for payroll related expenses were $2.9 billion and $3.4 billion and our liabilities for unredeemed gift card
s were $3.0 billion and $2.8 billion . We reduce the liability for a gift card when redeemed by a customer. 
The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based on customer usage pattern
s. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due in advance of performing 
our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue primarily relates to pre
payments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as of December 31, 2017 wa
s $6.1 billion , of which $5.3 billion was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018 , i
ncluding adjustments related to the new revenue recognition guidance. Included in "Other long-term liabiliti
es" on our consolidated balance sheets was $1.0 billion and $1.4 billion of unearned revenue as of December 
31, 2017 and 2018 . Additionally, we have performance obligations, primarily related to AWS, associated with
 commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized in our financial st
atements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, those commitments not yet recognized were 
$19.3 billion as of December 31, 2018 . The weighted average remaining life of our long-term contracts is 3.
3 years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is largely driven by customer usage, which ca
n extend beyond the original contractual term. Foreign Currency We have internationally-focused stores for w
hich the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expenses directly incurred from those operation
s, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional currency of our subsidiaries that either o
perate or support these stores is generally the same as the local currency. Assets and liabilities of these 
subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end foreign exchange rates, and revenues and expense
s are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the period. Translation adjustments are included in 
"Accumulated other comprehensive loss," a separate component of stockholders' equity, and in the "Foreign cu
rrency effect on cash and cash equivalents," on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Transaction gains
 and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency
 of the entity involved are included in "Other income (expense), net" on our consolidated statements of oper
ations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of intercompany balances, we recorded gains (los
ses) of $62 million , $202 million , and $(186) million in 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . 47 Table of Contents  Ac
counting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issu
ed an Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") amending revenue recognition guidance and requiring more detailed 
disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing, and uncertaint
y of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopted this ASU on January 1, 2018 fo
r all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective approach and increased retained 
earnings by approximately $650 million . The adjustment primarily relates to the unredeemed portion of our g
ift cards, which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period rather than waiting until gift c
ards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We changed the recognition and classificati
on of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single performance obligation and recognize
d ratably over the membership period as service sales. Previously, Prime memberships were considered to be a
rrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sales and service sales. Other chang
es relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising services are now classified as reven
ue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app content, and certain digital media co
ntent are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not been adjusted and continue to be reported in
 accordance with our historic accounting policy. The impact of applying this ASU for the year ended December
 31, 2018 primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increase in service sales driven by the r
eclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately $3.8 billion . Service sales also increased by app
roximately $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018 due to the reclassification of certain advertis
ing services. In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates certain aspects of recognition, measureme
nt, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Under this ASU, certain equity investments are me
asured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material 
impact to our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accoun
ting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an interc
ompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the transfer occurs. For intercompany transfe
rs of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred until the inventory has been sold to a 
third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of approximately $250 million to retained earni
ngs and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances. In November 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending t
he presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statements of cash flows. The new guidance requir
es that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the following impacts to our consolidated state
ments of cash flows (in millions): Year Ended December 31, 2016 Previously Reported  Adjustments  As Revised

tents  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accou
nting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of lease assets and liabilities for operating le
ases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those currently recorded, on our consolidated balance
 sheets. Presentation of leases within the consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements
 of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current lease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective
 for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. We will adopt this 
ASU on January 1, 2019 with an immaterial cumulative adjustment to retained earnings rather than retrospecti
vely adjusting prior periods. This adoption approach will result in a balance sheet presentation that will n
ot be comparable to the prior period in the first year of adoption. The adoption of this ASU will result in 
the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of approximately $21 billion , which includes the 
reclassification of finance leases to operating leases of approximately $1.2 billion , and the derecognition
 of build-to-suit lease assets and liabilities when we do not control the building during the construction p
eriod of approximately $1.5 billion . Note 2 -- CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND MARKETABLE SECU
RITIES As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , our cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securi

_ (1) We revised our prior year presentation of gross property and equipment and total accumulated depreciat
ion and amortization to include all property and equipment in service, including equipment which is fully-de
preciated, to conform to the current year presentation. Total property and equipment, net remains unchanged 
for the prior year. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $6.4 billion , $8.8 billion , and $12
.1 billion which includes amortization of property and equipment acquired under capital leases of $3.8 billi
on , $5.4 billion , and $7.3 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . Gross assets recorded under capital leases
 were $26.4 billion and $36.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortization associated
 with capital leases was $13.4 billion and $19.8 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . We capitalize co
nstruction in progress and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements whe
re we are considered the owner, for accounting purposes, during the construction period. For buildings under
 build-to-suit lease arrangements where we have taken occupancy, which do not qualify for sales recognition 
under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these
 buildings. This is principally due to our significant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the b
uildings are being depreciated over the shorter of their useful lives or the related leases' terms. Addition
ally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangements and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, 
the long-term construction obligations are considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payab
le during the next 12 months recorded as "Accrued expenses and other." Gross assets remaining under finance 
leases were $5.4 billion and as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . Accumulated amortization associated with fin
ance leases was $635 million and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As disclosed in "Note 1 -- 
Description of Business and Accounting Policies," our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will c
hange on January 1, 2019. Note 4 -- ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2016 Acquisition 
Activity During 2016 , we acquired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of $103 million . The p
rimary reason for these acquisitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial
 statements, was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 
51 Table of Contents  2017 Acquisition Activity On May 12, 2017 , we acquired Souq Group Ltd. ("Souq"), an e
-commerce company, for approximately $583 million , net of cash acquired, and on August 28, 2017, we acquire
d Whole Foods Market, a grocery store chain, for approximately $13.2 billion , net of cash acquired. Both ac
quisitions are intended to expand our retail presence. During 2017 , we also acquired certain other companie
s for an aggregate purchase price of $204 million . The primary reason for our other 2017 acquisitions was t
o acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 2018 Acquisition A
ctivity On April 12, 2018 , we acquired Ring Inc. ("Ring") for cash consideration of approximately $839 mill
ion , net of cash acquired, and on September 11, 2018 , we acquired PillPack, Inc. ("PillPack") for cash con
sideration of approximately $753 million , net of cash acquired, to expand our product and service offerings
. During 2018 , we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of $57 million . Th
e primary reason for our other 2018 acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon t
o serve customers more effectively. Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not signifi
cant. Pro forma results of operations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, ind
ividually and in the aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations. Purchase Price

 The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Fo
ods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and for general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the 
Notes was approximately $25.7 billion and $24.3 billion as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , which is based on
 quoted prices for our debt as of those dates. In October 2016, we entered into a $500 million secured revol
ving credit facility with a lender that is secured by certain seller receivables , which we subsequently inc
reased to $620 million and may from time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the "Cre
dit Facility"). The Credit Facility is available for a term of three years , bears interest at the London in
terbank offered rate (" LIBOR ") plus 1.65% , and has a commitment fee of 0.50% on the undrawn portion. Ther
e were $592 million and $594 million of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 
2017 and 2018 , which had a weighted-average interest rate of 2.7% and 3.2% as of December 31, 2017 and 2018
 . As of December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we 54 Table of Contents  have pledged $686 million of our cash and sel
ler receivables as collateral for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credi
t Facility, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 20
18 . The other debt, including the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of 5.8% and 6.0% as
 of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund c
ertain business operations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 
inputs, approximated its carrying value as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . As of December 31, 2018 , future 
principal payments for our total debt were as follows (in millions):  Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 1,371  
2020 1,298  2021 1,016  2022 1,266  2023 1,014  Thereafter 19,000   $ 24,965  In April 2018, we established 
a commercial paper program (the "Commercial Paper Program") under which we may from time to time issue unsec
ured commercial paper up to a total of $7.0 billion at any time, with individual maturities that may vary bu
t will not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial
 Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 . In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we 
amended and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the "Credit Agreement") with a syndicate of le
nders to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to $7.0 billion . As amended and restated, the Credit Ag
reement has a term of three years , but it may be extended for up to three additional one -year terms if app
roved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended and restated Cr
edit Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50% , with a commitment fee of 0.04% on the undrawn portion of the credit fac
ility. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2017 and 2018 . No

17 and 2018 , we have pledged or otherwise restricted $1.4 billion and $575 million of our cash, cash equiva
lents, and marketable securities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, a
mounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit. S
uppliers During 2018 , no vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-t
erm contracts or arrangements with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular paym
ent terms, or the extension of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed a
nd delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered b
y the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control l
aws. The consumer products included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty,
 jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our revi
ew is ongoing and we have voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department's Offic
e of Foreign Assets Control and the United States Department of Commerce's Bureau of Industry and Security. 
We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposit
ion of penalties. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, "Other Information -- Disclosure Pursu
ant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act." 57 Table of Contents  We are subject to claims related to various
 indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdic
tions in which we already collect and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully
 to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June
 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period f
rom January 2016 to March 2016, including interest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should 
have collected sales and use taxes on transactions by our third-party sellers. We believe the assessment is 
without merit. If South Carolina or other states were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a simil
ar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigo
rously in this matter. Legal Proceedings The Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, a
nd litigation, including the following: In November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-M
echana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com International Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.a r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Ama
zon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Commercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Mu
nich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to cus
tomers located in Austria. In July 2008, the German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in
 the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austrian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to repo
rt all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of damages. We conteste
d Austro-Mechana's claim and in September 2010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We los
t this appeal and in March 2011 commenced an appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Au
strian Supreme Court referred the case to the European Court of Justice ("ECJ"). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled
 that EU law does not preclude application of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the c
ase back to the Austrian Supreme Court for further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court 
referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the t
ariff on blank digital media meets the conditions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vi
enna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mec
hana's claims. In September 2015, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vi
enna. In December 2015, the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does
 not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana's appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana
 appealed that judgment to the Austrian Supreme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in fa
vor of Austro-Mechana and referred the case back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. 
A number of additional actions have been filed making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyri
ght collection society, Zentralstelle fur private Uberspielungsrechte ("ZPU"), filed a complaint against Ama
zon EU S.a r.l., Amazon Media EU S.a r.l., Amazon Services Europe S.a r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amaz
on Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Amazon Eurasia Holdings S.a r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg
 seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers locate
d in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian copyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Am
azon EU S.a r.l. in the Court of First Instance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank d
igital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail website to customers located in Belgium. In November 2013, the Bel
gian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff pote
ntially applies for a determination of damages. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defen
d ourselves vigorously in these matters. Beginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed allegin
g, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly wor
kers for time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statute
s and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed 
in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v. Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com In
c., another affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District 
Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In September 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Sta
ffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, 
and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District
 Court for the Western District of Kentucky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Ama
zon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the 
Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain cu
rrent and former employees under the Fair Labor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain 
current and former employees in states including Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky
, Washington, and Nevada, and one complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment clai
ms. The complaints seek an unspecified amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees. 
We have been named in several other similar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that ti
me spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wag
e and hour statute. In February 2015, the courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered s
tipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court
 for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs
 appealed the district court's judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In Ma
rch 2017, the court of 58 Table of Contents  appeals affirmed the district court's decision. In June 2017, t
he United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases wi
th prejudice. We dispute any remaining allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously i
n these matters. In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, 
Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services, LLC for patent infringement in the United States Distric
t Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual Private
 Cloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Scaling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, enti
tled "System and Method for Maintaining N Number of Simultaneous Cryptographic Sessions Using a Distributed 
Computing Environment." The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced da
mages, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States 
District Court for the Western District of Washington. In June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution 
of a review petition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January 2019, the stay 
of the case was lifted following resolution of the review petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing
 and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed 
a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. 
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of "interactive features" on www.amazon.com, includi
ng "search suggestions and search results," infringes U.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled "Distributed Hyper
media Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction and Display of
 Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document." The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together wi
th costs and attorneys' fees. In February 2016, Eolas filed an amended complaint seeking, among other things
, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damages report that in the event 
of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130 - $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the case
 was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the
 allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In October 2017, SRC La
bs, LLC and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe filed a complaint for patent infringement against Amazon Web Services, 
Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and VADATA, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Vir
ginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that certain AWS EC2 Instances infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 6
,434,687, entitled "System and method for accelerating web site access and processing utilizing a computer s
ystem incorporating reconfigurable processors operating under a single operating system image"; 7,149,867, e

ng parallelism and performance of computational functions"; and 9,153,311, entitled "System and method for r
etaining DRAM data when reprogramming reconfigurable devices with DRAM memory controllers." The complaint se
eks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, interest, and a compulsory on-going royalty. In Febr
uary 2018, the Virginia district court transferred the case to the United States District Court for the West
ern District of Washington. In November 2018, the case was stayed pending resolution of eight review petitio
ns filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office relating to the '324, '867, and '311 patents. We
 dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018
, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advances LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in
 the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York. The complaint alleges, among other 
things, that "Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled devices" infringe U.S. Patent No. 7,177,798, entitled "
Natural Language Interface Using Constrained Intermediate Dictionary of Results." The complaint seeks an inj
unction, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, an ongoing royalty, pre- and post-judgment inte

led "Producing Routing Messages For Voice Over IP Communications." The complaint seeks an unspecified amount
 of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys' fees, costs, and interest. In November 2018, the case was transfer
red to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations 
of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. 59 Table of Contents  In November 20
18, Dynamic Data Technologies, LLC filed a complaint for patent infringement against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazo

ed net tax provisions of $1.4 billion , $769 million , and $1.2 billion . We have tax benefits relating to e
xcess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to
 reduce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $412 million , $957 million , and $1.
2 billion for 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. T
ax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutory co
rporate tax rate from 35% to 21% , eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accu
mulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are
 subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated depreciati
on deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reason
ably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial statements 
as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of approxi
mately $789 million . This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax l
iabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 21% from 35% ,
 after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign subsidiarie
s. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounti
ng implications of the U.S. Tax Act. The components of the provision for income taxes, net are as follows (i

he U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. (2) Includes non-
deductible stock-based compensation and beginning in 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation
. For 2017 and 2018, our tax provision includes $1.3 billion and $1.6 billion of excess tax benefits from st
ock-based compensation. Our provision for income taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to exces
s tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partiall
y offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and a
udit-related developments. We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our d
eferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respe
ct to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and e
xpectations of future earnings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward period
s available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we recognized an estim
ated charge to tax expense of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asse
ts in Luxembourg. Our provision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increas
e in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. Th
is was partially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the pr
oportion of foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits
 from stock-based compensation. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U
.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to
 invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidia
ries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additiona
l costs upon repatriation of such amounts. 63 Table of Contents  Deferred income tax assets and liabilities

for income tax purposes were approximately $627 million , $7.8 billion , and $919 million . The federal, for
eign, and state net operating loss carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Interna
l Revenue Code and applicable foreign and state tax law. If not utilized, a portion of the federal, foreign,
 and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2029 , 2019 , and 2019 , respectively. A
s of December 31, 2018 , our tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately $1.7 billio
n . If not utilized, a portion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . As of December
 31, 2018 , our federal capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes was approximately $261 million . 
If not utilized, a portion of the capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2022 . Tax Contingencie
s We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Signifi
cant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. Du
ring the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate ta
x determination is uncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whet
her, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe t
hat certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully support
able. We adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audi
ts. The provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that ar
e considered appropriate. 64 Table of Contents  The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (i

   $ 3,414  ___________________ (1) As of December 31, 2018 , we had approximately $3.4 billion of accrued t
ax contingencies, of which $1.7 billion , if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2018 , we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, relat
ed to tax contingencies of $107 million and $127 million . Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax
 benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2016 , 2017 , and 2018 was $9 million , $40 million , 
and $20 million . These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our 
taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. As 
previously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment ("NOPAs") from the IRS for transaction
s undertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries.
 The IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal
 tax of approximately $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its d
ecision regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs
 in determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our forei
gn subsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. In September 2017, the IRS appealed t
he decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorou
sly in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully ass
ert transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we c
ould be subject to significant additional tax liabilities. In October 2014, the European Commission opened a
 formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the c
orporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On Oc
tober 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in 
Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commis
sion announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately EUR250 million , plus interest, for the period 
May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additio
nal taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European 
Commission's decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion
 of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we a
ppealed. We believe the European Commission's decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourse
lves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdic
tions including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be su
bject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these pa
rticular jurisdictions primarily for 2008 and thereafter. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies wi
ll grow in 2019 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax continge
ncies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimate
ly paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts 
accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments by 
various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictions
. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax 
filings in years through 2018 . The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ul
timate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possibl
e outcomes. Note 10 -- SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into three segments: North Ameri
ca, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses "Fulfillment," "Marketing,
" "Technology and content," and "General and administrative" based 65 Table of Contents  on usage, which is 
generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructur
e costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure te
chnology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no interna
l revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating d
ecision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations. The North America seg
ment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) an
d subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales
 from these online stores. The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales 
of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online store
s. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sal
es from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from ou
r North America-focused online stores. The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compu
te, storage, database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and acad
emic institutions. Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) i

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Exc
hange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act"), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal execut
ive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclos
ure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of December 31, 2018 . Based o
n this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of Dec
ember 31, 2018 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that 
information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is recor
ded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms and 
to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, inc
luding our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decis
ions regarding required disclosure. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Managem
ent is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as d
efined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal control 
over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integr
ated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a r
esult of this assessment, management concluded that, as of December 31, 2018 , our internal control over fin
ancial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial repo
rting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepte
d accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control 
over financial reporting and its report is included below. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Report
ing There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December
 31, 2018 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
 financial reporting. Limitations on Controls Our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control ov
er financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal c
ontrol over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter ho
w well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolut
e, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assura
nce that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of frau
d, if any, within the Company have been detected. 70 Table of Contents    Report of Independent Registered P
ublic Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders Amazon.com, Inc. Opinion on Internal Control O
ver Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting as of ,
 based on criteria established in Internal Control -- Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponso
ring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.c
om, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial repor
ting as of December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the stan
dards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance she
ets of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations,
 comprehensive income, stockholders' equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended 
December 31, 2018 and the related notes and our report dated January 31, 2019 expressed an unqualified opini
on thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal con
trol over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financia
l reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. O
ur responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based 
on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent w
ith respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and 
regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance wi
th the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonab
le assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all materia
l respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, asse
ssing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectivenes
s of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered nece
ssary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definitio
n and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company's internal control over financial r
eporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial report
ing and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted 
accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and pro
cedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly ref
lect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that t
ransactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with gener
ally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only i
n accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assu
rance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the compa
ny's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitatio
ns, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequat
e because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may det
eriorate.   /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington 71 Table of Contents

ed by reference to such reports. We are unable to accurately calculate the net profit attributable to these

we are enhancing our processes designed to identify transactions associated with individuals and entities co
vered by the ITRA. PART III
