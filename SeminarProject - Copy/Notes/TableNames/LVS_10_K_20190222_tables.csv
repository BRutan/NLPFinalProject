3,"During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded pre-opening expenses of $130 million driven by the opening of The Parisian Macao in September 2016, a nonrecurring corporate expense of $79 million and a loss on disposal or impairment of assets of $79 million primarily related to the write-off of costs related to the Las Vegas Condo Tower, as well as other dispositions at the Company's various operating properties."
