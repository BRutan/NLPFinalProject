Description,Judgments andUncertainties,Effect if Actual ResultsDiffer From Assumptions
Goodwill,,
Goodwill is assessed for impairment annually as of June 30 and as triggering events occur,"Goodwill is evaluated annually for impairment as of June 30 using either a quantitative or qualitative analysis at the reporting unit level, which is one level below our operating segments:  (a) The qualitative assessment begins with determination of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value before applying a two-step goodwill impairment model.(b) The quantitative analysis utilizes a two-step goodwill impairment model.Judgment is required in the two-step model. We estimate fair value using a combination of:(a) A discounted cash flow model that contains uncertainties related to the forecast of future results, as many outside economic and competitive factors can influence future performance. Margins, sales growth, and discount rates are the most critical estimates in determining enterprise values using the cash flow model.(b) The market approach using price to earnings ratios for comparable publicly traded companies that operate in the same or similar industry and with characteristics similar to the reporting unit.  Judgment is required to determine the appropriate price to earnings ratio","The June 2018 review indicated no goodwill impairments.  At December 31, 2018, we had $834 million of goodwill.  We recognized goodwill impairments of less than $5 million in 2017 and 2016 associated with the exit of a few small businesses that were evaluated for impairment when they were classified as held for sale. Information regarding material assumptions used to determine if a goodwill impairment exists can be found in Note D to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 82.We conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions, as well as future expectations. If we are not able to achieve projected performance levels, future impairments could be possible"


Table Title:,CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES_2
Description,Judgments andUncertainties,Effect if Actual ResultsDiffer From Assumptions
Other Long-lived Assets,,
Other long-lived assets are tested for recoverability at year-end and whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.For other long-lived assets we estimate fair value at the lowest level where cash flows can be measured (usually at a branch level).,"Impairments of other long-lived assets usually occur when major restructuring activities take place, or we decide to discontinue product lines completely. Our impairment assessments have uncertainties because they require estimates of future cash flows to determine if undiscounted cash flows are sufficient to recover carrying values of these assets. For assets where future cash flows are not expected to recover carrying value, fair value is estimated which requires an estimate of market value based upon asset appraisals for like assets.","These impairments are unpredictable. Impairments did not exceed $6 million per year in any of the last three years.At December 31, 2018, net property, plant and equipment was $729 million and net intangible assets other than goodwill was $179 million"
Inventory Reserves,,
"We reduce the carrying value of inventories to reflect an estimate of net realizable value for slow-moving (i.e., not selling very quickly) and obsolete inventory.Generally a reserve is required when we have more than one-year's supply of the product.The calculation also uses an estimate of the ultimate recoverability of items identified as slow-moving based upon historical experience.  If we have had no sales of a given product for 12 months, those items are generally deemed to be obsolete with no value and are written down completely.Finally, costs for approximately 50% of our inventories (consisting primarily of our domestic steel related inventories) are determined using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method, which produces a cost that is lower than net realizable value",Our inventory reserve contains uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions about the value of products that are obsolete or slow-moving.Changes in customer behavior and requirements can cause inventory to become obsolete or slow-moving.  Restructuring activity and decisions to narrow product offerings also impact the estimated net realizable value of inventories.,"At December 31, 2018, the reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventory was $27 million (approximately 4% of  inventories).  This is consistent with the reserves at December 31, 2017 and 2016, representing approximately 5% of inventories.   Additions to inventory reserves in 2018 were $10 million, which was slightly higher than our $8 million three-year average.  This increase is primarily associated with the 2018 Restructuring Plan as discussed in Note F to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 86, and we do not expect significant changes in our historical obsolescence levels"

Description,Judgments andUncertainties,Effect if Actual ResultsDiffer From Assumptions
Workers' Compensation,,
"We are substantially self-insured for costs related to workers' compensation, and this requires us to estimate the liability associated with this obligation.","Our estimates of self-insured reserves contain uncertainties regarding the potential amounts we might have to pay. We consider a number of factors, including historical claim experience, demographic factors, and potential recoveries from third party insurance carriers.","Over the past five years, we have incurred, on average, $8 million annually for costs associated with workers' compensation. Average year-to-year variation over the past five years has been approximately $1 million. At December 31, 2018, we had accrued $33 million to cover future self-insurance liabilities"
Credit Losses,,
"For accounts and notes receivable, we estimate a bad debt reserve for the amount that will ultimately be uncollectible. When we become aware of a specific customer's potential inability to pay, we record a bad debt reserve for the amount we believe may not be collectible.","Our bad debt reserve contains uncertainties because it requires management to estimate the amount uncollectible based upon an evaluation of several factors such as the length of time that receivables are past due, the financial  health of the customer, industry and macroeconomic considerations, and historical loss experience.Our customers are diverse and many are small-to-medium sized companies, with some being highly leveraged. Bankruptcy can occur with some of these customers relatively quickly and with little warning.In cases where a customer's payment performance or financial condition begins to deteriorate, we tighten our credit limits and terms and make appropriate reserves when deemed necessary.  Certain of our customers have from time to time experienced bankruptcy, insolvency and/or an inability to pay their debts to us as they come due. If our customers suffer significant financial difficulty, they may be unable to pay their debts to us timely or at all, they may reject their contractual obligations to us under bankruptcy laws or otherwise, or we may have to negotiate significant discounts and/or extend financing terms with these customers.","A significant change in the financial status of a large customer could impact our estimates.We believe we have established adequate reserves on our riskier customer accounts.  Although we recorded a $16 million reserve ($15 million on a note receivable and $1 million for a trade accounts receivable) for a customer in our Residential Products segment that is experiencing financial difficulty and liquidity problems, we have experienced favorable trends in the number of trade accounts receivable monitored for possible loss or written off in the last few years. The average annual amount of bad debt expense associated with customer trade accounts receivable was less than $2 million (significantly less than 1% of annual net sales) over the last three years. At December 31, 2018, our allowances for doubtful trade accounts receivable were $5 million (about 1% of our trade receivables of $552 million"

Pension Accounting,,
"For our pension plans, we must estimate the cost of benefits to be provided (well into the future) and the current value of those benefit obligations.In 2017, we completed an annuity purchase transaction for pensioners that were currently receiving a small monthly benefit.  Please see Note N to our Consolidated Financial Statements on page 103","The pension liability calculation contains uncertainties because it requires management's judgment.  Significant assumptions used to measure our pension liabilities and pension expense annually include: - the discount rate used to calculate the present value of future benefits - an estimate of expected return on pension assets based upon the mix of investments held (bonds and equities) - certain employee-related factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality.  Mortality assumptions represent our best estimate of the duration of future benefit payments at the measurement date.  These estimates are based on each plans' demographics and other relevant facts and circumstances - the rate of salary increases where benefits are based on earnings","Each 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate increases pension expense by $.4 million and increases the plans' benefit obligation by $6.8 million.A 25 basis point reduction in the expected return on assets would increase pension expense by $.4 million, but have no effect on the plans' funded status. Assuming a long-term investment horizon, we do not expect a material change to the return on asset assumption"
Contingencies,,
"We evaluate various legal, environmental, and other potential claims against us to determine if an accrual or disclosure of the contingency is appropriate. If it is probable that an ultimate loss will be incurred and reasonably estimable, we accrue a liability for the estimate of the loss.","Our disclosure and accrual of loss contingencies (i.e., losses that may or may not occur) contain uncertainties because they are based on our assessment of the probability that the expenses will actually occur, and our reasonable estimate of the likely cost. Our estimates and judgments are subjective and can involve matters in litigation, the results of which are generally unpredictable.","Legal contingencies are related to numerous lawsuits and claims described in Note U to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 119. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2018, we recorded expense of $13 million ($9 million for continuing operations and $4 million in discontinued operations).There were no material uninsured individual claims during the three-year period ending December 31, 2018"

Income Taxes,,
"In the ordinary course of business, we must make estimates of the tax treatment of many transactions, even though the ultimate tax outcome may remain uncertain for some time. These estimates become part of the annual income tax expense reported in our financial statements. Subsequent to year end, we finalize our tax analysis and file income tax returns. Tax authorities periodically audit these income tax returns and examine our tax filing positions, including (among other things) the timing and amounts of deductions, and the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. If necessary, we adjust income tax expense in our financial statements in the periods in which the actual outcome becomes more certain.","Our tax liability for unrecognized tax benefits contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures related to our various filing positions. Our effective tax rate is also impacted by changes in tax laws, the current mix of earnings by taxing jurisdiction, and the results of current tax audits and assessments.  In December 2017, the U.S. enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which resulted in significant changes to U.S. federal income tax law affecting the Company.  Current and expected impacts are based on our current knowledge of the legislation and other authoritative guidance which has been issued, including proposed regulations.  At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $14 million and $11 million, respectively, of net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet primarily related to net operating losses and other tax carryforwards. The ultimate realization of these deferred tax assets is dependent upon the amount, source, and timing of future taxable income. In cases where we believe it is more likely than not that we may not realize the future potential tax benefits, we establish a valuation allowance against them","Changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws could impact assumptions related to the repatriation of certain foreign earnings. Audits by various taxing authorities continue as governments look for ways to raise additional revenue. Based upon past audit experience, we do not expect any material changes to our tax liability as a result of this audit activity; however, we could incur additional tax expense if we have audit adjustments higher than recent historical experience. The likelihood of recovery of net operating losses and other tax carryforwards has been closely evaluated and is based upon such factors as the time remaining before expiration, viable tax planning strategies, and future taxable earnings expectations. We believe that appropriate valuation allowances have been recorded as necessary. However, if earnings expectations or other assumptions change such that additional valuation allowances are required, we could incur additional tax expense.  Likewise, if fewer valuation allowances are needed, we could incur reduced tax expense."

Acquisitions,,
"When acquisitions occur, we value the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in acquired companies at estimated acquisition date fair values.  Goodwill is measured as the excess amount of consideration transferred, compared to fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.  Our estimates of fair value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain.","The purchase price allocation for business acquisitions contains uncertainties because it requires management's judgment. Determining fair value of identifiable assets, particularly intangibles, require management to make estimates, which are based on all available information and in some cases assumptions with respect to the timing and amount of future revenues and expenses associated with an asset.  Determining fair values for these items require significant judgment and includes a variety of methods and models that utilize significant Level 3 inputs as discussed in Note R to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 113","In 2018, we acquired three businesses for total consideration of $109 million. As discussed in Note V to the Consolidated Financial Statements on page 121, on January 16, 2019, we completed the acquisition of Elite Comfort Solutions, Inc. (ECS) for cash consideration of approximately $1.25 billion.The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. We regularly review for impairments. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results"
