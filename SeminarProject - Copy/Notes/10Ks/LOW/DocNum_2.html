Advances shall be unsecured and interest free.  Advances shall include all reasonable Expenses incurred in pursuing a Proceeding to enforce this right of advancement, including Expenses incurred preparing and forwarding statements to the Company to support the advances claimed.

         <font style="font-family:inherit;font-size:10pt;">
          (a)  A determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification shall be made:  (i) if no Change in Control has occurred, (1) by the Board by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of Disinterested Directors; or (2) if a quorum cannot be obtained under clause (1), by majority vote of a committee duly designated by the Board (in which designated directors who are not Disinterested Directors may participate), consisting solely of two or more Disinterested Directors; (3) by Independent Counsel (A) selected by the Board or its committee in the manner prescribed in clauses (1) or (2); or (B) if a quorum of the Board cannot be obtained under clause (1) and a committee cannot be designated under clause (2), selected by majority vote of the Board (in which selection directors who are not Disinterested Directors parties may participate); or (4) by the shareholders, but shares owned by or voted under the control of directors who are not Disinterested Directors may not be voted; and (ii) if a Change in Control has occurred, at the election of the Indemnitee, either (1) in accordance with Section 12(a)(i) or (2) by Independent Counsel selected by the Indemnitee.   Unless the determination is made by Independent Counsel, the Company promptly will advise Indemnitee in writing with respect to any determination that Indemnitee is or is not entitled to indemnification, including a description of any reason or basis for which indemnification has been denied.  If it is so determined that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification, payment to Indemnitee shall be made within ten days after such determination.  Indemnitee shall reasonably cooperate with the Person or Persons making such determination with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification, including providing to such Person or Persons upon reasonable advance request any documentation or information which is not privileged or otherwise protected from disclosure and which is reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to such determination.  Any Expenses (including attorneys’ fees and disbursements) incurred by Indemnitee in so cooperating with the person, persons or entity making such determination shall be borne by the Company (irrespective of the determination as to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification), and the Company hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold Indemnitee harmless therefrom.

If such written objection is so made and substantiated, the Independent Counsel so selected may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit.  If, within 20 days after submission by Indemnitee of a written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, no Independent Counsel shall have been selected and not objected to, either the Company or Indemnitee may petition the a court of competent jurisdiction for resolution of any objection which shall have been made by the Company or Indemnitee to the other’s selection of Independent Counsel and/or for the appointment as Independent Counsel of a person selected by such court, and the person with respect to whom all objections are so resolved or the person so appointed shall act as Independent Counsel under Section 12(a) hereof.  Upon the due commencement of any judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to Section 14(a) hereof, Independent Counsel shall be discharged and relieved of any further responsibility in such capacity (subject to the applicable standards of professional conduct then prevailing).

          (a)  In making a determination with respect to entitlement to indemnification hereunder, the Person or Persons making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if Indemnitee has submitted a request for indemnification in accordance with Section 11(b) hereof, and the Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption in connection with the making by any Person or Persons of any determination contrary to that presumption.  Neither the failure of the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of any action pursuant to this Agreement that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because Indemnitee has met the applicable standard of conduct, nor an actual determination by the Company (including by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct.

If Indemnitee commences a judicial proceeding or arbitration pursuant to this Section, then Indemnitee shall not be required to reimburse the Company for any advances pursuant to Section 10 hereof until a final determination is made with respect to Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification (as to which all rights of appeal have been exhausted or lapsed).
