         <u>
          Interest Rates; LIBOR
Notification
         </u>
         . The interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans is determined by reference to the LIBO Rate, which is derived from the
London interbank offered rate. The London interbank offered rate is intended to represent the rate at which contributing banks
may obtain short-term borrowings from each other in the London interbank market. In July 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority
announced that, after the end of 2021,it would no longer persuade or compel contributing banks to make rate submissions to the
ICE Benchmark Administration (together with any successor to the ICE Benchmark Administrator, the 
         <b>
          <i>
           IBA
          </i>
         </b>
         )
for purposes of the IBA setting the London interbank offered rate. As a result, it is possible that commencing in 2022, the London
interbank offered rate may no longer be available or may no longer be deemed an appropriate reference rate upon which to determine
the interest rate on Eurocurrency Loans. In light of this eventuality, public and private sector industry initiatives are currently
underway to identify new or alternative reference rates to be used in place of the London interbank offered rate. In the event
that the London interbank offered rate is no longer available or in certain other circumstances as set forth in Section 2.14(b)
of this Agreement, such Section 2.14(b) provides a mechanism for determining an alternative rate of interest. The Administrative
Agent will notify the Company, pursuant to Section 2.14, in advance of any change to the reference rate upon which the interest
rate on Eurocurrency Loans is based. However, the Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall
not have any liability with respect to, the administration, submission or any other matter related to the London interbank offered
rate or other rates in the definition of LIBO Rate or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto,
or replacement rate thereof, including without limitation, whether the composition or characteristics of any such alternative,
successor or replacement reference rate, as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.14(b), will be similar to, or produce
the same value or economic equivalence of, the LIBO Rate or have the same volume or liquidity as did the London interbank offered
rate prior to its discontinuance or unavailability.

herein, request in accordance with Section 2.03 that such payment be financed with an ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing of
the applicable Class, as applicable, in an equivalent amount and currency and, to the extent so financed, the Borrowers
obligations to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Facility Borrowing. If the Borrowers
fail to reimburse any L/C Disbursement when due, then the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the applicable Issuing Bank
and each other applicable Revolving Facility Lender of the applicable L/C Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrowers
in respect thereof and, in the case of a Revolving Facility Lender, such Lenders Revolving Facility Percentage thereof.
Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Facility Lender with a Revolving Facility Commitment of the applicable
Class shall pay to the Administrative Agent in Dollars, its Revolving Facility Percentage (as specified by the Administrative Agent
to such Revolving Facility Lender at the time) of the payment then due from the Borrowers in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06
with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
         <u>

         , to the payment obligations
of the Revolving Facility Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the applicable Issuing Bank the amounts
so received by it from the Revolving Facility Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from
the Borrowers pursuant to this paragraph, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank
or, to the extent that Revolving Facility Lenders have made payments pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse such Issuing Bank,
then to such Lenders in Dollars and such Issuing Bank as their interests may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Facility Lender
pursuant to this paragraph to reimburse an Issuing Bank for any L/C Disbursement (other than the funding of an ABR Revolving Loan
as contemplated above) shall not constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrowers of their obligation to reimburse such L/C
Disbursement.

thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance

Borrowers and each Extending Lender shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Incremental Assumption Agreement and
such other documentation as the Administrative Agent shall reasonably specify to evidence the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended
Revolving Facility Commitments of such Extending Lender. Each Incremental Assumption Agreement shall specify the terms of the applicable
Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments;
         <u>
          provided
         </u>
         that (i) except as to interest rates, fees,
amortization, call premiums, call protection, final maturity date and participation in prepayments (which shall, subject to clauses
(ii) through (v) of this proviso, be determined by the Borrowers and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), the Extended Term
Loans shall have (x) the same terms as the Term A Loans, or (y) such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, (ii) the final maturity date of any Extended Term Loans shall be no earlier than the latest Term Facility Maturity Date
in effect on the date of incurrence, (iii) the weighted average life to maturity of any Extended Term Loans shall be no shorter
than the remaining weighted average life to maturity of the Class of Term Loans to which such offer relates, (iv) except as to
interest rates, fees and final maturity and the matters addressed by Section 2.21(b)(iv) (which shall be determined by the
Borrowers and set forth in the Pro Rata Extension Offer), any Extended Revolving Facility Commitment shall have (x) the same terms
as the existing Revolving Facility Commitments or (y) have such other terms as shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative
Agent, and (v) any Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments may participate on a pro rata basis or a
less than pro rata basis (but not greater than a pro rata basis) in any voluntary or mandatory repayments or prepayments hereunder.
Upon the effectiveness of any Incremental Assumption Agreement, this Agreement shall be amended to the extent (but only to the
extent) necessary to reflect the existence and terms of the Extended Term Loans and/or Extended Revolving Facility Commitments
evidenced thereby as provided for in Section 10.08(e). Any such deemed amendment may be memorialized in writing by the Administrative
Agent with the Borrowers consent (not to be unreasonably withheld) and furnished to the other parties hereto. If provided
in any Incremental Assumption Agreement with respect to any Extended Revolving Facility Commitments, and with the consent of each
Issuing Bank, participations in Letters of Credit shall be reallocated to lenders holding such Extended Revolving Facility Commitments
in the manner specified in such Incremental Assumption Agreement, including upon effectiveness of such Extended Revolving Facility
Commitment or upon or prior to the maturity date for any Class of Revolving Facility Commitment.

Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision
of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such persons own gross negligence or willful misconduct)
or (b) responsible in any manner to any of the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any
Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement

other Loan Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder.
The Agents shall not be under any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or performance of any
of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books
or records of any Loan Party. The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those expressly set forth
herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not
be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties, regardless of whether a Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
and (b) the Administrative Agent shall not, except as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, have any duty
to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Borrowers or any of their Affiliates
that is communicated to or obtained by the person serving as the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity.
The Administrative Agent shall be deemed not to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless and until written notice
describing such Default or Event of Default is given to such Agent by a Borrower, a Lender or an Issuing Bank. Neither Agent shall
be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection

of any Collateral, or (vi) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than to confirm
receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.

and believed by it to have been made by the proper person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Administrative
Agent may conclusively rely on information provided to it by the Former Agent with respect to the Original Credit Agreement. In
determining compliance with any condition hereunder to any Credit Event, that by its terms must be fulfilled to the satisfaction
of a Lender or any Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent may presume that such condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing
Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank prior to such
Credit Event. The Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to the Loan Parties), independent accountants
and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice
of any such counsel, accountants or experts. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof
for all purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof shall have been filed with the Administrative
Agent. Each Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any other Loan Document
(including with respect to any matter hereunder or under any other Loan Document that is subject to such Agents consent
or approval) unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement,
all or other Lenders) as it (or, in the case of the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent) deems appropriate or it shall first
be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by reason
of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in
refraining from acting, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the Required Lenders
(or, if so specified by this Agreement, all of the Lenders), and such request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto
shall be binding upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

Lender to reimburse any Agent or any Issuing Bank, as the case may be, promptly upon demand for its ratable share of any amount

any other Lender of its obligation hereunder to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for its ratable
share of such amount, but no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to reimburse such Agent or such Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, for such other Lenders ratable share of such amount. The agreements in this Section shall survive

If the Administrative Agent shall resign as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, then the Required
Lenders shall appoint from among the Lenders a successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of
Default under Section 8.01(b), (c), (h) or (i) shall have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Company

asserts a claim that the Administrative Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the account of any Lender
for any reason (including because the appropriate form was not delivered, was not properly executed, or because such Lender failed
to notify the Administrative Agent of a change in circumstances that rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding

all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Administrative Agent as Tax or otherwise, including penalties, additions to Tax

Affiliates or stockholders or any other person or entity for any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages, which may
be alleged as a result of the Facilities, the Transactions or the Acquisition Transactions. The provisions of this Section 10.05

Guarantor Pledge Agreement in a transaction not prohibited by Section 6.05 the Collateral Agent, without any recourse to or

such documents as may be reasonably requested by the Borrowers and at the Borrowers expense to release any Liens created
by any Loan Document in respect of such Equity Interests or assets, and, in the case of a disposition of the Equity Interests of
any Subsidiary Guarantor in a transaction permitted by Section 6.05 and as a result of which such Subsidiary Guarantor would cease
to be a Subsidiary, terminate such Subsidiary Guarantors obligations under its Guarantee (and, in each case, the Administrative
Agent and the Collateral Agent may rely conclusively on a certificate to that effect provided to it by any Loan Party upon its
reasonable request without further inquiry). Any such release shall not in any manner discharge, affect, or impair the Obligations
or any Liens (other than those being released) upon (or obligations (other than those being released) of the Loan Parties in respect
of) all interests retained by the Loan Parties, including the proceeds of any sale, all of which shall continue to constitute part

the Collateral Agent agrees, without any recourse to or representation by it, to take such actions as are reasonably requested
by the Borrowers and at the Borrowers expense to terminate the Liens and security interests created by the Loan Documents
when all the Obligations (other than contingent indemnification obligations and expense reimbursement claims to the extent no claim
therefore has been made) are paid in full and all Letters of Credit and Commitments are terminated. Any such release of Obligations
shall be deemed subject to the provision that such Obligations shall be reinstated if after such release any portion of any payment
in respect of the Obligations guaranteed thereby shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored or returned upon the insolvency,
bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization of any Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the
appointment of a receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, any Borrower or any Subsidiary Guarantor
or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. Any representation, warranty
or covenant contained in any Loan Document relating to any such Equity Interests, asset or subsidiary of a Borrower shall no longer
be deemed to be made once such Equity Interests or asset is so conveyed, sold, leased, assigned, transferred or disposed of.

such distribution, to the sentence immediately following) to which the Obligations are entitled under any intercreditor agreement
(other than this Agreement) (all proceeds of any sale, collection or other liquidation of any Collateral and all proceeds of any
such distribution being collectively referred to as 

and (ii) SECOND, subject to Section 1.01(b), to the extent any Proceeds remain after payment pursuant to clause (i), to the payment
in full of the Obligations of each Series on a ratable basis in accordance with the terms of the applicable Secured Credit Documents.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Shared Collateral for which a third party (other than a Secured Party) has a
lien or security interest that is junior in priority to the security interest of any Series of Obligations but senior (as determined
by appropriate legal proceedings in the case of any dispute) to the security interest of any other Series of Obligations (such
third party an 

such Intervening Creditor shall be deducted on a ratable basis solely from the Shared Collateral or Proceeds to be distributed
in respect of the Series of Obligations with respect to which such Impairment exists. If, despite the provisions of Section 2.01(a)(ii),
any Secured Party shall receive any payment or other recovery in excess of its portion of payments on account of the Obligations
to which it is then entitled in accordance with this Section 2.01(a), such Secured Party shall hold such payment or recovery in
trust for the benefit of all Secured Parties for distribution in accordance with this Section 2.01(a).

          Joinder
Requirements
         </u>
         . The Borrower and/or any First Lien Agent and/or any Second Priority Agent, without the consent of any other First
Lien Agent or Second Priority Agent, any Senior Lender or any Second Priority Secured Party, may designate additional obligations
as Other First Priority Lien Obligations or Future Second Lien Indebtedness if the incurrence of such obligations is permitted
under each of the Credit Agreement, each Other First Priority Lien Obligations Credit Document, the Second Priority Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, each other relevant Senior Lender Document and Second Priority Document and this Agreement. If so permitted, as
a condition precedent to the effectiveness of such designation, the applicable Other First Priority Lien Obligations Agent or the
Second Lien Agent for such Future Second Lien Indebtedness shall execute and deliver to each First Lien Agent and Second Priority
Agent, a joinder agreement to this Agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the First Lien Designated Agent.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 9.20 or in Section 9.3 hereof, any First Lien Agent and/or any
Second Priority Agent may, and, at the request of the Borrower, shall, in each case, without the consent of any other First Lien
Agent or Second Priority Agent, any Senior Lender or any Second Priority Secured Party, enter into a supplemental agreement (which
may take the form of an amendment, an amendment and restatement or a supplement of this Agreement) to facilitate the designation
of such additional obligations as Other First Priority Lien Obligations or Future Second Lien Indebtedness. Any such amendment
may, among other things, (i) add other parties holding Future Second Lien Indebtedness (or any agent or trustee therefor)
to the extent such Indebtedness is permitted by the Credit Agreement, each Other First Priority Lien Obligations Credit Documents,
the Second Priority Senior Secured Notes Indenture and each other Second Priority Document governing Future Second Lien Indebtedness,
(ii) add other parties holding Obligations arising under the Other First Priority Lien Obligations Credit Documents (or any
agent or trustee thereof) to the extent such Obligations are permitted by the Credit Agreement, each Other First Priority Lien
Obligations Credit Document, the Second Priority Senior Secured Notes Indenture and each other Second Priority Document governing
Future Second Lien Indebtedness, (iii) in the case of Future Second Lien Indebtedness, (a) establish that the Lien on
the Common Collateral securing such Future Second Lien Indebtedness shall be junior and subordinate in all respects to all Liens
on the Common Collateral securing any Senior Lender Claims and shall share in the benefits of the Common Collateral equally and
ratably with all Liens on the Common Collateral securing any Second Priority Claims, and (b) provide to the holders of such
Future Second Lien Indebtedness (or any agent or trustee thereof) the comparable rights and benefits (including any improved rights
and benefits that have been consented to by the First Lien Agents) as are provided to the holders of Second Priority Claims under
the foregoing Agreement immediately prior to the incurrence of such Future Second Lien Indebtedness, and (iv) in the case
of Obligations arising under Other First Priority Lien Obligations Credit Documents, (a) establish that the Lien on the Common
Collateral securing such Obligations shall be superior in all respects to all Liens on the Common Collateral securing any Second
Priority Claims and any Future Second Lien Indebtedness and shall share in the benefits of the Common Collateral equally and ratably
with all Liens on the Common Collateral securing any other Senior Lender Claims, and (b) provide to the holders of such Obligations
arising under the Other First Priority Lien Obligations Credit Documents (or any agent or trustee thereof) the comparable rights
and benefits as are provided to the holders of Senior Lender Claims under the foregoing Agreement immediately prior to the incurrence
of such Obligations. Any such additional party, each First Lien Agent and each Second Priority Agent shall be entitled to rely
on the determination of officers of the Borrower that such modifications are permitted by the Credit Agreement, the Other First
Priority Lien Obligations Credit Documents, the Second Priority Senior Secured Notes Indenture and each other Second Priority Document
governing Future Second Lien Indebtedness if such determination is set forth in an officers certificate of an authorized
officer of the Borrower delivered to such party, the First Lien Agents and each Second Priority Agent;
         <u>
          provided
         </u>
         ,
         <u>
          however
         </u>
         ,
that such determination will not affect whether or not the Borrower has complied with its undertakings in the Credit Agreement,
the Other First Priority Lien Obligations Credit Documents, the Senior Collateral Documents, the Second Priority Senior Secured
Notes Indenture, any other Second Priority Document governing Future Second Lien Indebtedness or the Second Priority Collateral
Documents.

voting rights, control of the Common Collateral and waivers with respect to the Common Collateral, in each case so long as (A) the
terms thereof do not violate or conflict with the provisions of this Agreement or the other Senior Collateral Documents or Second
Priority Collateral Documents, as the case may be, (B) in the case of any such intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement)
affecting any Senior Secured Parties, the First Lien Agent acting on behalf of such Senior Secured Parties agrees in its sole discretion
to enter into any such intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement) and (C) in the case of any such intercreditor agreement
(or similar arrangement) affecting the Senior Secured Parties holding Senior Lender Claims under the Credit Agreement, such intercreditor
agreement (or similar arrangement) is permitted under the Credit Agreement or the Required Lenders otherwise authorize the applicable
First Lien Agent to enter into any such intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement). Notwithstanding the preceding clauses
(B) and (C), to the extent that the applicable First Lien Agent is not authorized by the Required Lenders to enter into any such
intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement ) or does not agree to enter into such intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement
), such intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement) shall not be binding upon the applicable First Lien Agent but, subject
to the immediately succeeding sentence, may still bind the other parties party thereto. In any event, if a respective intercreditor
agreement (or similar arrangement) exists, the provisions thereof shall not be (or be construed to be) an amendment, modification
or other change to this Agreement or any other Senior Collateral Document or Second Priority Collateral Document, and the provisions
of this Agreement and the other Senior Collateral Documents and Second Priority Collateral Documents shall remain in full force
and effect in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof (as such provisions may be amended, modified or otherwise supplemented
from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof, including to give effect to any intercreditor agreement (or similar arrangement)).
