         It being in the interest of the Company
for non-employee directors of its Board to review and assess the Company’s products, the non-employee directors of the Board
are encouraged to take one cruise with one of the Company’s brands annually. Accordingly, the Company will annually provide
to each non-employee director one cabin for an up to 14 night cruise with the Company brand of their choice. Non-employee directors
and a guest of their choice will be accommodated in a penthouse level (or Haven equivalent) cabin with such accommodation to be
assigned by the Company’s revenue management department. The non-employee director will be responsible for taxes, port fees
and fuel supplements as well as all onboard spending and transportation to and from the ship (other than any transportation that
would otherwise be included in the ticket price of the cruise).
