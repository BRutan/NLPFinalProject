             Exhibit 10.5                                        BORGWARNER INC.                                  2018 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN                                                                            Restricted Stock Agreement—Employees                        BorgWarner, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the “Company), hereby awards to the         Employee indicated below a Restricted Stock Award (the “Award”) under the BorgWarner Inc.         2018 Stock Incentive Plan (the “Plan”), as specified below, effective as of the Grant Date,         according to the terms and conditions of this Restricted Stock Agreement (this “Agreement”)         and the Plan.  All capitalized terms shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Plan, unless         specifically set forth otherwise herein.  The parties hereto agree as follows:          Grant Information:         Employee Name:          Employee Address:          Grant Date:   October 2018         Number of Restricted Shares Awarded: x,xxx Shares         Terms and Conditions:                 1.    Restriction Period.  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, the Restriction              Period for the Restricted Stock awarded to the Employee under this Agreement shall              commence with the Grant Date set forth above and shall end, for the percentage of the              Shares indicated below (each percentage of Shares and the associated vesting date is              referred to as a “Tranche”), on the date when the Restricted Stock shall have vested in              accordance with the following schedule provided that the Employee remains              continuously employed by or in the service of the Company or an Affiliate through the              applicable vesting date:                             Vesting Date                   Vested Percentage                             October 8, 2019               1/3 of the Awarded Shares                              October 8, 2020               1/3 of the Awarded Shares                              October 8, 2021               1/3 of the Awarded Shares                       Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the application of the above vesting schedule would              cause a fractional Share to vest, then the number of Shares that vest on such date shall              be rounded down to the nearest whole number.                              Prior to the date that the Restriction Period applicable to Shares of Restricted Stock              lapses, the Employee shall not be permitted to sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise              encumber such Shares of Restricted Stock.                  4846-1583-6518.5

(a)  The Company shall, as soon as administratively feasible after execution of this                     Agreement by the Employee, either (1) issue one or more certificates in the                     name of the Employee representing the Shares covered by this Award, or (2)                     direct the Company’s transfer agent for the Stock to make a book entry record                     showing ownership for the Restricted Stock in the name of the Employee, subject                     to the terms and conditions of the Plan and this Agreement.                                        (b)  In the event that the Company issues one or more certificates for the Restricted                     Stock covered by this Award in lieu of book entry, during the applicable                     Restriction Period:                                             (i)  The certificate or certificates shall bear the following legend:                                                        “The transferability of this certificate and the shares of stock represented                           hereby are subject to the terms and conditions (including forfeiture) of the                           2018 Stock Incentive Plan and a Restricted Stock Agreement.  Copies of                           such Plan and Restricted Stock Agreement are on file at the headquarters                           offices of BorgWarner Inc.”                                                   (ii)  The certificates shall be held in custody by the Company until the                           restrictions set forth herein shall have lapsed; and                                                   (iii)  As a condition to receipt of this Award, the Employee hereby authorizes                           the Company to issue such instructions to the transfer agent as the                           Company may deem necessary or proper to comply with the intent and                           purposes of this Agreement and the Plan, including provisions regarding                           forfeiture. This paragraph shall be deemed to constitute the stock power,                           endorsed in blank, contemplated by Section 8.2 of the Plan.                                                     (c)  At the Employee’s request, if and when the applicable Restriction Period expires                     for a Share or Shares granted hereunder without a prior forfeiture, the Company                     will deliver certificate(s) for such Share(s) to the Employee.                                    3.    Termination of Employment.  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 3 or Section              4, the Employee shall forfeit the Shares that are unvested as of the effective date of the              Employee’s Termination of Employment.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, except as              otherwise determined by the Committee, in its sole discretion, at the time of the              Employee’s Termination of Employment, the following provisions shall apply.                             (a)   Death or Disability.  If the Employee’s Termination of Employment is due to the                    Employee’s death or Disability, then all the unvested Shares shall immediately                    vest.                      (b)   Retirement.  If the Employee’s Termination of Employment is due to Retirement,                    then the Committee may, in its sole discretion, cause all or a portion of the                    unvested Shares to vest.                                   (c)  Effective Date of Termination of Employment. For purposes of this Agreement,                    any Termination of Employment shall be effective as of the earlier of (1) the date                    that the Company receives the Employee’s notice of resignation of employment,    4846-1583-6518.5

             Exhibit 10.5                     or (2) the date that the Employee ceases to actively provide services. In                    connection with the foregoing, the applicable termination date shall not be                    extended by any notice period mandated under local law (e.g., “garden leave” or                    similar period pursuant to local law), and the Company shall have the exclusive                    discretion to determine when the Employee is no longer actively providing                    service for purposes of this Award.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Employee                    will be deemed to have experienced a Termination of Employment upon the                    Employee’s “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A of the                    Code to the extent this Award is subject to Section 409A of the Code.                      4.    Change in Control.  In the event of a Change in Control, this Award shall be treated in              accordance with Section 15 of the Plan, provided, however, that for purposes of Section              15.1(a)(5), the Employee will be considered to have terminated the Employee’s              employment or service for “good reason” if the Employee’s termination either (a) meets              the requirements set forth in Exhibit A attached to this Agreement or (b) constitutes a              “good reason” termination under the Employee’s employment, retention, change in              control, severance or similar agreement with the successor, purchaser, the Company, or              any affiliate thereof, if any.                      5.    Stockholder Rights.  Subject to the restrictions imposed by this Agreement and the Plan,              the Employee shall have, with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by this Award, all              of the rights of a stockholder of the Company holding Stock, including the right to vote              the Shares and the right to receive dividends; provided , however, that any cash              dividends payable with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by this Award shall be              automatically reinvested in additional Shares of Restricted Stock, the number of which              shall be determined by multiplying (a) the number of Shares that the Employee has been              issued under this Agreement as of the dividend record date that have not vested as of              such record date by (b) the dividend paid on each Share, and dividing the result by (c)              the Fair Market Value of a Share on the dividend payment date.  Such additional Shares              so awarded shall vest at the same time, and to the same extent, as the Restricted Stock              to which it relates and shall be subject to the same restrictions, terms and conditions              contained herein.  Dividends payable with respect to the Restricted Stock covered by              this Award that are payable in Stock shall also be paid in the form of additional Shares of              Restricted Stock and shall vest at the same time, and to the same extent, as the              Restricted Stock to which it relates and shall be subject to the same restrictions, terms,              and conditions contained herein.                      6.    Tax Withholding. The Company shall have the power and the right to deduct or withhold,              or require the Employee or beneficiary to remit to the Company, an amount sufficient to              satisfy federal, state, and local taxes, domestic or foreign, required by law or regulation              to be withheld with respect to any taxable event arising as a result of this Agreement.                The Employee acknowledges that the ultimate liability for all taxes legally due by the              Employee is and remains the Employee’s responsibility, and the Company: (a) makes no              representations or undertakings regarding the tax treatment of this Award; and (b) does              not commit to structure the terms of this Award to reduce or eliminate the Employee’s              tax liability.         7.    Acquisition of Shares For Investment Purposes Only.  By accepting this Award, the              Employee hereby agrees with the Company as follows:                              (a)   The Employee is acquiring the Shares covered by this Award for investment                    purposes only and not with a view to resale or other distribution thereof to the    4846-1583-6518.5

Miscellaneous.                            (a)   Nontransferability.

(b)   Notices.

(c)   Failure To Enforce Not a Waiver.  The failure of the Company to enforce at any                    time any provision of this Agreement shall in no way be construed to be a waiver                    of such provision or of any other provision hereof.                (d)   Governing Law.  The Award made and actions taken under the Plan and this                    Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of                    the State of Delaware without taking into account its conflict of laws provisions.

(f)   Section 16 Compliance.  To the extent necessary to comply with, or to avoid                    disgorgement of profits under the short-swing matching rules of, Section 16 of                    the Exchange Act, the Employee shall not sell or otherwise dispose of the                    Shares.               (g)   No Right to Continued Employment.  Nothing contained in the Plan or this                    Agreement shall confer upon the Employee any right to continued employment                    nor shall it interfere in any way with the right of the Company or any subsidiary or                    Affiliate to terminate the employment of the Employee at any time.                 (h)   Discretionary Nature of Plan; No Right to Additional Awards.  The Employee                    acknowledges and agrees that the Plan is discretionary in nature and limited in                    duration and may be amended, cancelled, or terminated by the Company, in its                    sole discretion, at any time.  The grant of an Award under the Plan is a one-time                    benefit and does not create any contractual or other right to receive an Award or                    benefits in lieu of an Award.  Future awards, if any, will be at the sole discretion                    of the Company, including, but not limited to, the form and timing of an award,                    the number of Shares subject to the award, and the vesting provisions.               (i)   Termination Indemnities.  The value of this Award is an extraordinary item of                    compensation outside the scope of the Employee’s employment contract, if any.                     As such, Awards are not part of normal or expected compensation for purposes                    of calculating any severance, resignation, redundancy, end of service payments,                    bonuses, long-service awards, pension, or retirement benefits or similar                    payments.                                    (j)   Acceptance of Award.  By accepting this Award, the Employee agrees to accept                    all the terms and conditions of the Award, as set forth in this Agreement and in                    the Plan.  This Agreement shall not be effective as a Restricted Stock Award if a                    copy of this Agreement is not signed by the Employee and returned to the                    Company (unless the Employee accepts this award in an alternative means                    approved by the Company, which may include electronic acceptance).                (k)   Binding Effect.  Subject to the limitations stated above, this Agreement shall be                    binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties’ respective heirs, legal                    representatives successors and assigns.               (l)   Amendment of the Agreement.  Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the                    Company and the Employee may amend this Agreement only by a written                    instrument signed by both parties.               (m)   Counterparts.  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all                    of which together shall constitute but one Agreement.               (n)   Electronic Delivery.  The Company may, in its sole discretion, decide to deliver                    any documents related to this Award by electronic means.  The Employee hereby                    consents to receive such documents by electronic delivery and agrees to                    participate in the Plan through an on-line or electronic system established and                    maintained by the Company or a third party designated by the Company.   4846-1583-6518.5
