             Statutory Restrictions on Ownership.
            </i>
           </b>
           The Nevada Code contains provisions
restricting the ability of a Nevada corporation to engage in business combinations with an interested stockholder. Under the Nevada Code, except under certain circumstances, business combinations with interested stockholders are not permitted for a
period of two years following the date such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder. The Nevada Code defines an interested stockholder, generally, as a person who is the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, of 10% of the outstanding
shares of a Nevada corporation. In addition, the Nevada Code generally disallows the exercise of voting rights with respect to control shares of an issuing corporation held by an acquiring person, unless such
voting rights are conferred by a majority vote of the disinterested stockholders. Control shares are those outstanding voting shares of an issuing corporation which an acquiring person and those persons acting in association with an
acquiring person (i) acquire or offer to acquire in an acquisition of a controlling interest and (ii) acquire within ninety days immediately preceding the date when the acquiring person became an acquiring person. An issuing
corporation is a corporation organized in Nevada which has two hundred or more stockholders, at least one hundred of whom are stockholders of record and residents of Nevada, and which does business in Nevada directly or through an affiliated
corporation. The Nevada Code also permits directors to resist a change or potential change in control of the corporation if the directors determine that the change or potential change is opposed to or not in the best interest of the corporation. As
a result, AutoZones Board of Directors may have considerable discretion in considering and responding to unsolicited offers to purchase a controlling interest in AutoZone.
