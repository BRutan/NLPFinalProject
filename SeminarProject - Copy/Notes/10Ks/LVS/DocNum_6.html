the Cotai area an integrated entertainment and gaming center of high quality, capable of competing with other similar developments that may arise in Southeast Asian countries, as well as taking into account the authorizations granted by the
Government to the development of the construction works and the amount invested by the applicant with them, only using self-financing since to date it could not mortgage the right resulting from the concession, and taking into account also the
intention of the applicant to resume the works, which will create jobs in the construction sector, DSSOPT issued favorable opinions to the approval of the concession and to the approval of the replacement of the applicant in the concession procedure
