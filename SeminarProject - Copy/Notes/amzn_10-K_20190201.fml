<subsection name: "Business">
Amazon.com, Inc. was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and reincorporated in 1996 in the state
 of Delaware. Our principal corporate offices are located in Seattle, Washington. We completed our initial p
ublic offering in May 1997 and our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbo
l “AMZN.” As used herein, “Amazon.com,” “we,” “our,” and similar terms include Amazon.com, Inc. and its subs
idiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise. General We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric compan
y. We are guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention,
 commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. In each of our segments, we serve our primary
 customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. In addition
, we provide services, such as advertising.         We have organized our operations into three segments: No
rth America, International, and Amazon Web Services (“AWS”). These segments reflect the way the Company eval
uates its business performance and manages its operations. Information on our net sales is contained in Item
 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.” The financial 
results of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial 
statements from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Consumers We serve consumers through our online 
and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We design our stores to enable hundreds 
of millions of unique products to be sold by us and by third parties across dozens of product categories. Cu
stomers access our offerings through our websites, mobile apps, Alexa, and physically visiting our stores. W
e also manufacture and sell electronic devices, including Kindle e-readers, Fire tablets, Fire TVs, and Echo
 devices, and we develop and produce media content. We strive to offer our customers the lowest prices possi
ble through low everyday product pricing and shipping offers, and to improve our operating efficiencies so t
hat we can continue to lower prices for our customers. We also provide easy-to-use functionality, fast and r
eliable fulfillment, and timely customer service. In addition, we offer Amazon Prime, a membership program t
hat includes unlimited free shipping on over 100 million items, access to unlimited streaming of thousands o
f movies and TV episodes, and other benefits. We fulfill customer orders in a number of ways, including thro
ugh: North America and International fulfillment and delivery networks that we operate; co-sourced and outso
urced arrangements in certain countries; digital delivery; and through our physical stores. We operate custo
mer service centers globally, which are supplemented by co-sourced arrangements. See Item 2 of Part I, “Prop
erties.” Sellers We offer programs that enable sellers to grow their businesses, sell their products in our 
stores, and fulfill orders through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. We earn fixed 
fees, a percentage of sales, per-unit activity fees, interest, or some combination thereof, for our seller p
rograms. Developers and Enterprises We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes, including start-ups, g
overnment agencies, and academic institutions, through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of global c
ompute, storage, database, and other service offerings.  3  Content Creators We serve authors and independen
t publishers with Kindle Direct Publishing, an online service that lets independent authors and publishers c
hoose a royalty option and make their books available in the Kindle Store, along with Amazon’s own publishin
g arm, Amazon Publishing. We also offer programs that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app de
velopers, and others to publish and sell content. Competition Our businesses encompass a large variety of pr
oduct types, service offerings, and delivery channels. The worldwide marketplace in which we compete is evol
ving rapidly and intensely competitive, and we face a broad array of competitors from many different industr
y sectors around the world. Our current and potential competitors include: (1) physical, e-commerce, and omn
ichannel retailers, publishers, vendors, distributors, manufacturers, and producers of the products we offer
 and sell to consumers and businesses; (2) publishers, producers, and distributors of physical, digital, and
 interactive media of all types and all distribution channels; (3) web search engines, comparison shopping w
ebsites, social networks, web portals, and other online and app-based means of discovering, using, or acquir
ing goods and services, either directly or in collaboration with other retailers; (4) companies that provide
 e-commerce services, including website development, advertising, fulfillment, customer service, and payment
 processing; (5) companies that provide fulfillment and logistics services for themselves or for third parti
es, whether online or offline; (6) companies that provide information technology services or products, inclu
ding on-premises or cloud-based infrastructure and other services; and (7) companies that design, manufactur
e, market, or sell consumer electronics, telecommunication, and electronic devices. We believe that the prin
cipal competitive factors in our retail businesses include selection, price, and convenience, including fast
 and reliable fulfillment. Additional competitive factors for our seller and enterprise services include the
 quality, speed, and reliability of our services and tools, as well as customers’ ability and willingness to
 change business practices. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources, longer his
tories, more customers, greater brand recognition, and greater control over inputs critical to our various b
usinesses. They may secure better terms from suppliers, adopt more aggressive pricing, pursue restrictive di
stribution agreements that restrict our access to supply, direct consumers to their own offerings instead of
 ours, lock-in potential customers with restrictive terms, and devote more resources to technology, infrastr
ucture, fulfillment, and marketing. Each of our businesses is also subject to rapid change and the developme
nt of new business models and the entry of new and well-funded competitors. Other companies also may enter i
nto business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive positions. Intellectual Property We
 regard our trademarks, service marks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress, trade secrets, propri
etary technologies, and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, 
copyright, and patent law, trade-secret protection, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our e
mployees, customers, partners, and others to protect our proprietary rights. We have registered, or applied 
for the registration of, a number of U.S. and international domain names, trademarks, service marks, and cop
yrights. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain of our prop
rietary technology. We have licensed in the past, and expect that we may license in the future, certain of o
ur proprietary rights to third parties. Seasonality Our business is affected by seasonality, which historica
lly has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized  32
% ,  34% , and  31%  of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of  2016 ,  , and  2018 . Fourth quarte
r 2017 results include revenue attributable to Whole Foods Market, which we acquired on August 28, 2017. Emp
loyees We employed approximately  647,500  full-time and part-time employees as of  . However, employment le
vels fluctuate due to seasonal factors affecting our business. Additionally, we utilize independent contract
ors and temporary personnel to supplement our workforce. We have works councils, statutory employee represen
tation obligations, and union agreements in certain countries outside the United States and at certain of ou
r studio operations within the United States. We consider our employee relations to be good. Competition for
 qualified personnel in our industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineers, com
puter scientists, and other technical staff. Available Information Our investor relations website is amazon.
com/ir and we encourage investors to use it as a way of easily finding information about us. We promptly mak
e available on this website, free of charge, the reports that we file or furnish with the  4  Securities and
 Exchange Commission (“SEC”), corporate governance information (including our Code of Business Conduct and E
thics), and select press releases. Executive Officers and Directors The following tables set forth certain i

<subsection name: "Risk Factors">
Please carefully consider the following risk factors. If any of the following risks occur, our business, fin
ancial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the
 current global economic climate amplifies many of these risks. We Face Intense Competition Our businesses a
re rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries, includi
ng physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail, e-commerce services, digital content and electronic devices
, web and infrastructure computing services, and transportation and logistics services, and across geographi
es, including cross-border competition. Some of our current and potential competitors have greater resources
, longer histories, more customers, and/or greater brand recognition, particularly with our newly-launched p
roducts and services and in our newer geographic regions. They may secure better terms from vendors, adopt m
ore aggressive pricing, and devote more resources to technology, infrastructure, fulfillment, and marketing.
 Competition may intensify, including with the development of new business models and the entry of new and w
ell-funded competitors, and as our competitors enter into business combinations or alliances and established
 companies in other market segments expand to become competitive with our business. In addition, new and enh
anced technologies, including search, web and infrastructure computing services, digital content, and electr
onic devices, may increase our competition. The Internet facilitates competitive entry and comparison shoppi
ng, and increased competition may reduce our sales and profits. Our Expansion Places a Significant Strain on
 our Management, Operational, Financial, and Other Resources We are rapidly and significantly expanding our 
global operations, including increasing our product and service offerings and scaling our infrastructure to 
support our retail and services businesses. This expansion increases the complexity of our business and plac
es significant strain on our management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial re
sources, and internal financial control and reporting functions. We may not be able to manage growth effecti
vely, which could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating results. Our 
Expansion into New Products, Services, Technologies, and Geographic Regions Subjects Us to Additional Busine
ss, Legal, Financial, and Competitive Risks We may have limited or no experience in our newer market segment
s, and our customers may not adopt our offerings. These offerings may present new and difficult technology c
hallenges, and we may be subject to claims if customers of these offerings experience service disruptions or
 failures or other quality issues. In addition, profitability, if any, in our newer activities may be lower 
than in our older activities, and we may not be successful enough in these newer activities to recoup our in
vestments in them. If any of this were to occur, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negat
ively affect our operating results. We May Experience Significant Fluctuations in Our Operating Results and 
Growth Rate We may not be able to accurately forecast our growth rate. We base our expense levels and invest
ment plans on sales estimates. A significant portion of our expenses and investments is fixed, and we may no
t be able to adjust our spending quickly enough if our sales are less than expected. Our revenue growth may 
not be sustainable, and our percentage growth rates may decrease. Our revenue and operating profit growth de
pends on the continued growth of demand for the products and services offered by us or our sellers, and our 
business is affected by general economic and business conditions worldwide. A softening of demand, whether c
aused by changes in customer preferences or a weakening of the U.S. or global economies, may result in decre
ased revenue or growth. Our sales and operating results will also fluctuate for many other reasons, includin
g due to risks described elsewhere in this section and the following: • our ability to retain and increase s
ales to existing customers, attract new customers, and satisfy our customers’ demands; • our ability to reta
in and expand our network of sellers; • our ability to offer products on favorable terms, manage inventory, 
and fulfill orders; • the introduction of competitive stores, websites, products, services, price decreases,
 or improvements; • changes in usage or adoption rates of the Internet, e-commerce, electronic devices, and 
web services, including outside the U.S.; 6  • timing, effectiveness, and costs of expansion and upgrades of
 our systems and infrastructure; • the success of our geographic, service, and product line expansions; • th
e extent to which we finance, and the terms of any such financing for, our current operations and future gro
wth; • the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, which may include significant monetary damages or injun
ctive relief and could have a material adverse impact on our operating results; • variations in the mix of p
roducts and services we sell; • variations in our level of merchandise and vendor returns; • the extent to w
hich we offer free shipping, continue to reduce prices worldwide, and provide additional benefits to our cus
tomers; • factors affecting our reputation or brand image; • the extent to which we invest in technology and
 content, fulfillment, and other expense categories; • increases in the prices of fuel and gasoline, as well
 as increases in the prices of other energy products and commodities like paper and packing supplies; • the 
extent to which our equity-method investees record significant operating and non-operating items; • the exte
nt to which operators of the networks between our customers and our stores successfully charge fees to grant
 our customers unimpaired and unconstrained access to our online services; • our ability to collect amounts 
owed to us when they become due; • the extent to which use of our services is affected by spyware, viruses, 
phishing and other spam emails, denial of service attacks, data theft, computer intrusions, outages, and sim
ilar events; and • terrorist attacks and armed hostilities. Our International Operations Expose Us to a Numb
er of Risks Our international activities are significant to our revenues and profits, and we plan to further
 expand internationally. In certain international market segments, we have relatively little operating exper
ience and may not benefit from any first-to-market advantages or otherwise succeed. It is costly to establis
h, develop, and maintain international operations and stores, and promote our brand internationally. Our int
ernational operations may not be profitable on a sustained basis. In addition to risks described elsewhere i
n this section, our international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including: • local 
economic and political conditions; • government regulation (such as regulation of our product and service of
ferings and of competition); restrictive governmental actions (such as trade protection measures, including 
export duties and quotas and custom duties and tariffs); nationalization; and restrictions on foreign owners
hip; • restrictions on sales or distribution of certain products or services and uncertainty regarding liabi
lity for products, services, and content, including uncertainty as a result of less Internet-friendly legal 
systems, local laws, lack of legal precedent, and varying rules, regulations, and practices regarding the ph
ysical and digital distribution of media products and enforcement of intellectual property rights; • busines
s licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports, web services, and electronic device
s; • limitations on the repatriation and investment of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions; • l
imited fulfillment and technology infrastructure; • shorter payable and longer receivable cycles and the res
ultant negative impact on cash flow; • laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection, privacy,
 network security, encryption, payments, and restrictions on pricing or discounts; • lower levels of use of 
the Internet; • lower levels of consumer spending and fewer opportunities for growth compared to the U.S.; •
 lower levels of credit card usage and increased payment risk; • difficulty in staffing, developing, and man
aging foreign operations as a result of distance, language, and cultural differences; 7  • different employe
e/employer relationships and the existence of works councils and labor unions; • compliance with the U.S. Fo
reign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to gover
nment officials and other third parties; • laws and policies of the U.S. and other jurisdictions affecting t
rade, foreign investment, loans, and taxes; and • geopolitical events, including war and terrorism. As inter
national physical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services grow, competition will intensify, i
ncluding through adoption of evolving business models. Local companies may have a substantial competitive ad
vantage because of their greater understanding of, and focus on, the local customer, as well as their more e
stablished local brand names. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, and manage required personnel, whic
h may limit our international growth. The People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) and India regulate Amazon’s and
 its affiliates’ businesses and operations in country through regulations and license requirements that may 
restrict (i) foreign investment in and operation of the Internet, IT infrastructure, data centers, retail, d
elivery, and other sectors, (ii) Internet content, and (iii) the sale of media and other products and servic
es. For example, in order to meet local ownership and regulatory licensing requirements, www.amazon.cn is op
erated by PRC companies that are indirectly owned, either wholly or partially, by PRC nationals. In addition
, we provide certain technology services in China in conjunction with third parties that hold PRC licenses t
o provide services. In India, the government restricts the ownership or control of Indian companies by forei
gn entities involved in online multi-brand retail trading activities. For www.amazon.in, we provide certain 
marketing tools and logistics services to third-party sellers to enable them to sell online and deliver to c
ustomers, and we hold indirect minority interests in entities that are third-party sellers on the www.amazon
.in marketplace. Although we believe these structures and activities comply with existing laws, they involve
 unique risks, and the PRC and India are actively considering changes in their foreign investment rules that
 could impact these structures and activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretat
ion of PRC and Indian laws and regulations, and it is possible that these governments will ultimately take a
 view contrary to ours. In addition, our Chinese and Indian businesses and operations may be unable to conti
nue to operate if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or in China enforce contractu
al relationships with respect to management and control of such businesses. If our international activities 
were found to be in violation of any existing or future PRC, Indian or other laws or regulations or if inter
pretations of those laws and regulations were to change, our businesses in those countries could be subject 
to fines and other financial penalties, have licenses revoked, or be forced to restructure our operations or
 shut down entirely.  If We Do Not Successfully Optimize and Operate Our Fulfillment Network and Data Center
s, Our Business Could Be Harmed If we do not adequately predict customer demand or otherwise optimize and op
erate our fulfillment network and data centers successfully, it could result in excess or insufficient fulfi
llment or data center capacity, or result in increased costs, impairment charges, or both, or harm our busin
ess in other ways. As we continue to add fulfillment and data center capability or add new businesses with d
ifferent requirements, our fulfillment and data center networks become increasingly complex and operating th
em becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectiv
ely. In addition, a failure to optimize inventory in our fulfillment network will increase our net shipping 
cost by requiring long-zone or partial shipments. We and our co-sourcers may be unable to adequately staff o
ur fulfillment network and customer service centers. If the other businesses on whose behalf we perform inve
ntory fulfillment services deliver product to our fulfillment centers in excess of forecasts, we may be unab
le to secure sufficient storage space and may be unable to optimize our fulfillment network.  We rely on a l
imited number of shipping companies to deliver inventory to us and completed orders to our customers. If we 
are not able to negotiate acceptable terms with these companies or they experience performance problems or o
ther difficulties, it could negatively impact our operating results and customer experience. In addition, ou
r ability to receive inbound inventory efficiently and ship completed orders to customers also may be negati
vely affected by inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts of war or ter
rorism, acts of God, and similar factors. Under some of our commercial agreements, we maintain the inventory
 of other companies, thereby increasing the complexity of tracking inventory and operating our fulfillment n
etwork. Our failure to properly handle such inventory or the inability of these other companies to accuratel
y forecast product demand would result in unexpected costs and other harm to our business and reputation. 8 
 The Seasonality of Our Business Places Increased Strain on Our Operations We expect a disproportionate amou
nt of our net sales to occur during our fourth quarter. If we do not stock or restock popular products in su
fficient amounts such that we fail to meet customer demand, it could significantly affect our revenue and ou
r future growth. If we overstock products, we may be required to take significant inventory markdowns or wri
te-offs and incur commitment costs, which could reduce profitability. We may experience an increase in our n
et shipping cost due to complimentary upgrades, split-shipments, and additional long-zone shipments necessar
y to ensure timely delivery for the holiday season. If too many customers access our websites within a short
 period of time due to increased demand, we may experience system interruptions that make our websites unava
ilable or prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of goods we sell and th
e attractiveness of our products and services. In addition, we may be unable to adequately staff our fulfill
ment network and customer service centers during these peak periods and delivery and other fulfillment compa
nies and customer service co-sourcers may be unable to meet the seasonal demand. We also face risks describe
d elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment network optimization and inventory. We generally have pa
yment terms with our retail vendors that extend beyond the amount of time necessary to collect proceeds from
 our consumer customers. As a result of holiday sales, as of December 31 of each year, our cash, cash equiva
lents, and marketable securities balances typically reach their highest level (other than as a result of cas
h flows provided by or used in investing and financing activities). This operating cycle results in a corres
ponding increase in accounts payable as of December 31. Our accounts payable balance generally declines duri
ng the first three months of the year, resulting in a corresponding decline in our cash, cash equivalents, a
nd marketable securities balances. Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in Making, Integrating, 
and Maintaining Commercial Agreements, Strategic Alliances, and Other Business Relationships We provide phys
ical, e-commerce, and omnichannel retail and other services to businesses through commercial agreements, str
ategic alliances, and business relationships. Under these agreements, we provide web services, technology, f
ulfillment, computing, digital storage, and other services, as well as enable sellers to offer products or s
ervices through our stores. These arrangements are complex and require substantial infrastructure capacity, 
personnel, and other resource commitments, which may limit the amount of business we can service. We may not
 be able to implement, maintain, and develop the components of these commercial relationships, which may inc
lude web services, fulfillment, customer service, inventory management, tax collection, payment processing, 
hardware, content, and third-party software, and engaging third parties to perform services. The amount of c
ompensation we receive under certain of our commercial agreements is partially dependent on the volume of th
e other company’s sales. Therefore, if the other company’s offerings are not successful, the compensation we
 receive may be lower than expected or the agreement may be terminated. Moreover, we may not be able to ente
r into additional commercial relationships and strategic alliances on favorable terms. We also may be subjec
t to claims from businesses to which we provide these services if we are unsuccessful in implementing, maint
aining, or developing these services. As our agreements terminate, we may be unable to renew or replace thes
e agreements on comparable terms, or at all. We may in the future enter into amendments on less favorable te
rms or encounter parties that have difficulty meeting their contractual obligations to us, which could adver
sely affect our operating results. Our present and future e-commerce services agreements, other commercial a
greements, and strategic alliances create additional risks such as: • disruption of our ongoing business, in
cluding loss of management focus on existing businesses; • impairment of other relationships; • variability 
in revenue and income from entering into, amending, or terminating such agreements or relationships; and • d
ifficulty integrating under the commercial agreements. Our Business Could Suffer if We Are Unsuccessful in M
aking, Integrating, and Maintaining Acquisitions and Investments We have acquired and invested in a number o
f companies, and we may acquire or invest in or enter into joint ventures with additional companies. These t
ransactions (such as our acquisition of Whole Foods Market, Inc.) create risks such as: • disruption of our 
ongoing business, including loss of management focus on existing businesses; • problems retaining key person
nel; • additional operating losses and expenses of the businesses we acquired or in which we invested; • the
 potential impairment of tangible and intangible assets and goodwill, including as a result of acquisitions;
 9  • the potential impairment of customer and other relationships of the company we acquired or in which we
 invested or our own customers as a result of any integration of operations; • the difficulty of completing 
such transactions and achieving anticipated benefits within expected timeframes, or at all;  • the difficult
y of incorporating acquired operations, technology, and rights into our offerings, and unanticipated expense
s related to such integration; • the difficulty of integrating a new company’s accounting, financial reporti
ng, management, information and information security, human resource, and other administrative systems to pe
rmit effective management, and the lack of control if such integration is delayed or not implemented; • for 
investments in which an investee’s financial performance is incorporated into our financial results, either 
in full or in part, the dependence on the investee’s accounting, financial reporting, and similar systems, c
ontrols, and processes; • the difficulty of implementing at companies we acquire the controls, procedures, a
nd policies appropriate for a larger public company; • the risks associated with businesses we acquire or in
vest in, which may differ from or be more significant than the risks our other businesses face; • potential 
unknown liabilities associated with a company we acquire or in which we invest; and • for foreign transactio
ns, additional risks related to the integration of operations across different cultures and languages, and t
he economic, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. As a result of future acqui
sitions or mergers, we might need to issue additional equity securities, spend our cash, or incur debt, cont
ingent liabilities, or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, any of which could reduce our pro
fitability and harm our business or only be available on unfavorable terms, if at all. In addition, valuatio
ns supporting our acquisitions and strategic investments could change rapidly given the current global econo
mic climate. We could determine that such valuations have experienced impairments or other-than-temporary de
clines in fair value which could adversely impact our financial results. We Have Foreign Exchange Risk The r
esults of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our international stores 
and product and service offerings are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, opera
ting results may differ materially from expectations, and we may record significant gains or losses on the r
emeasurement of intercompany balances. As we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to exc
hange rate fluctuations has increased. We also hold cash equivalents and/or marketable securities in foreign
 currencies including British Pounds, Euros, and Japanese Yen. If the U.S. Dollar strengthens compared to th
ese currencies, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, when translated, may be materially les
s than expected and vice versa. The Loss of Key Senior Management Personnel or the Failure to Hire and Retai
n Highly Skilled and Other Key Personnel Could Negatively Affect Our Business We depend on our senior manage
ment and other key personnel, particularly Jeffrey P. Bezos, our President, CEO, and Chairman. We do not hav
e “key person” life insurance policies. We also rely on other highly skilled personnel. Competition for qual
ified personnel in the technology industry has historically been intense, particularly for software engineer
s, computer scientists, and other technical staff. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key em
ployees or the inability to hire, train, retain, and manage qualified personnel, could harm our business. We
 Could Be Harmed by Data Loss or Other Security Breaches Because we process, store, and transmit large amoun
ts of data, including personal information, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breac
hes, including breaches of our vendors’ or customers’ technology and systems, could expose us or our custome
rs to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litiga
tion or potential liability for us, deter customers or sellers from using our stores and services, and other
wise harm our business and reputation. We use third-party technology and systems for a variety of reasons, i
ncluding, without limitation, encryption and authentication technology, employee email, content delivery to 
customers, back-office support, and other functions. Some of our systems have experienced past security brea
ches, and, although they did not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, there can be no as
surance of a similar result in the future. Although we have developed systems and processes that are designe
d to protect customer information and prevent data loss and other security breaches, including  10  systems 
and processes designed to reduce the impact of a security breach at a third-party vendor or customer, such m
easures cannot provide absolute security. We Face Risks Related to System Interruption and Lack of Redundanc
y We experience occasional system interruptions and delays that make our websites and services unavailable o
r slow to respond and prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders or providing services to third parties, 
which may reduce our net sales and the attractiveness of our products and services. If we are unable to cont
inually add software and hardware, effectively upgrade our systems and network infrastructure, and take othe
r steps to improve the efficiency of our systems, it could cause system interruptions or delays and adversel
y affect our operating results. Our computer and communications systems and operations could be damaged or i
nterrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, earthquakes, acts of war or terrorism, ac
ts of God, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins, and similar events or disruptions. Any of the
se events could cause system interruption, delays, and loss of critical data, and could prevent us from acce
pting and fulfilling customer orders and providing services, which could make our product and service offeri
ngs less attractive and subject us to liability. Our systems are not fully redundant and our disaster recove
ry planning may not be sufficient. In addition, we may have inadequate insurance coverage to compensate for 
any related losses. Any of these events could damage our reputation and be expensive to remedy. We Face Sign
ificant Inventory Risk In addition to risks described elsewhere in this Item 1A relating to fulfillment netw
ork and inventory optimization by us and third parties, we are exposed to significant inventory risks that m
ay adversely affect our operating results as a result of seasonality, new product launches, rapid changes in
 product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes in consumer demand and consumer spending pattern
s, changes in consumer tastes with respect to our products, spoilage, and other factors. We endeavor to accu
rately predict these trends and avoid overstocking or understocking products we manufacture and/or sell. Dem
and for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory or components are ordered and
 the date of sale. In addition, when we begin selling or manufacturing a new product, it may be difficult to
 establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product or component selection, and accurately foreca
st demand. The acquisition of certain types of inventory or components may require significant lead-time and
 prepayment and they may not be returnable. We carry a broad selection and significant inventory levels of c
ertain products, such as consumer electronics, and we may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantitie
s or during the relevant selling seasons. Any one of the inventory risk factors set forth above may adversel
y affect our operating results. We May Not Be Able to Adequately Protect Our Intellectual Property Rights or
 May Be Accused of Infringing Intellectual Property Rights of Third Parties We regard our trademarks, servic
e marks, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology, and similar intellectual p
roperty as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright, and patent law, trade secret protec
tion, and confidentiality and/or license agreements with our employees, customers, and others to protect our
 proprietary rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in whi
ch our products and services are made available. We also may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate 
domain names in all countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain names may n
ot protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be unable to prevent third parties from acq
uiring domain names that are similar to, infringe upon, or diminish the value of our trademarks and other pr
oprietary rights. We may not be able to discover or determine the extent of any unauthorized use of our prop
rietary rights. Third parties that license our proprietary rights also may take actions that diminish the va
lue of our proprietary rights or reputation. The protection of our intellectual property may require the exp
enditure of significant financial and managerial resources. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intel
lectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misapprop
riating our proprietary rights. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or othe
rwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or other intellectual property rights. Other parties also ma
y claim that we infringe their proprietary rights. We have been subject to, and expect to continue to be sub
ject to, claims and legal proceedings regarding alleged infringement by us of the intellectual property righ
ts of third parties. Such claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant f
inancial and managerial resources, injunctions against us, or the payment of damages, including to satisfy i
ndemnification obligations. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have infrin
ged their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. In addition, w
e may not be able to obtain or utilize on terms that are favorable to us, or at all, licenses or other right
s with respect to intellectual property we do not own. These risks have been amplified by the increase in th
ird parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims. 11  Our digital content offerings depen
d in part on effective digital rights management technology to control access to digital content. If the dig
ital rights management technology that we use is compromised or otherwise malfunctions, we could be subject 
to claims, and content providers may be unwilling to include their content in our service. We Have a Rapidly
 Evolving Business Model and Our Stock Price Is Highly Volatile We have a rapidly evolving business model. T
he trading price of our common stock fluctuates significantly in response to, among other risks, the risks d
escribed elsewhere in this Item 1A, as well as: • changes in interest rates; • conditions or trends in the I
nternet and the industry segments we operate in; • quarterly variations in operating results; • fluctuations
 in the stock market in general and market prices for Internet-related companies in particular; • changes in
 financial estimates by us or securities analysts and recommendations by securities analysts; • changes in o
ur capital structure, including issuance of additional debt or equity to the public; • changes in the valuat
ion methodology of, or performance by, other e-commerce or technology companies; and • transactions in our c
ommon stock by major investors and certain analyst reports, news, and speculation. Volatility in our stock p
rice could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and force us to increase our cash compe
nsation to employees or grant larger stock awards than we have historically, which could hurt our operating 
results or reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders, or both. Government Regulation Is E
volving and Unfavorable Changes Could Harm Our Business We are subject to general business regulations and l
aws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, physical, e-commerce, and omnichan
nel retail, electronic devices, and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may impede our 
growth. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyright
s, distribution, transportation, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, e
nergy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, con
sumer protection, employment, trade and protectionist measures, web services, the provision of online paymen
t services, information reporting requirements, unencumbered Internet access to our services or access to ou
r facilities, the design and operation of websites, health and sanitation standards, the characteristics, le
gality, and quality of products and services, product labeling, and the commercial operation of unmanned air
craft systems. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, data pr
otection, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce, digital content, web services, and artific
ial intelligence technologies and services. Jurisdictions may regulate consumer-to-consumer online businesse
s, including certain aspects of our seller programs. Unfavorable regulations, laws, and decisions interpreti
ng or applying those laws and regulations could diminish the demand for, or availability of, our products an
d services and increase our cost of doing business. We Could Be Subject to Additional Tax Liabilities and Co
llection Obligations We are subject to a variety of taxes and tax collection obligations in the U.S. (federa
l and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. We may recognize additional tax expense and be subject to a
dditional tax liabilities, including other liabilities for tax collection obligations due to changes in laws
, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes t
o the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. Such 
changes could come about as a result of economic, political, and other conditions. An increasing number of j
urisdictions are considering or have adopted laws or administrative practices that impose new tax measures, 
including revenue-based taxes, targeting online commerce and the remote selling of goods and services. These
 include new obligations to collect sales, consumption, value added, or other taxes on online marketplaces a
nd remote sellers, or other requirements that may result in liability for third party obligations. For examp
le, the European Union, certain member states, and other countries have proposed or enacted taxes on online 
advertising and marketplace service revenues. Our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely ef
fected by additional taxes of this nature imposed on us or additional taxes or penalties resulting from the 
failure to comply with any collection obligations or failure to provide information about our customers, sup
pliers, and other third parties for tax reporting purposes to various government agencies. In some cases we 
also may not have sufficient notice to enable us to build systems and adopt processes to properly comply by 
the effective date. 12  Our tax expense and liabilities may also be affected by other factors, such as chang
es in our business operations, acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, interco
mpany transactions, the relative amount of our foreign earnings, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which 
we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicability of special tax regimes, changes in foreig
n currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, and changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilitie
s and their valuation. Significant judgment is required in evaluating and estimating our tax expense and lia
bilities. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the
 ultimate tax determination is uncertain. For example, the legislation known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs A
ct of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”) requires complex computations to be performed that were not previously requi
red by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in interpretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Ac
t, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation and analysis of information not previously rel
evant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will c
ontinue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of the U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise ad
ministered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustments to amounts that we have previously recorde
d that may materially impact our financial statements in the period in which the adjustments are made. We ar
e also currently subject to tax controversies in various jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess a
dditional tax liabilities against us. Developments in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy coul
d have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that deve
lopment occurs, as well as for prior and subsequent periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an advers
e outcome resulting from these proceedings to determine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believ
e our tax estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of audits, investigations, and any other tax controver
sies could be materially different from our historical tax accruals. Our Supplier Relationships Subject Us t
o a Number of Risks We have significant suppliers, including licensors, and in some cases, limited or single
-sources of supply, that are important to our sourcing, services, manufacturing, and any related ongoing ser
vicing of merchandise and content. We do not have long-term arrangements with most of our suppliers to guara
ntee availability of merchandise, content, components, or services, particular payment terms, or the extensi
on of credit limits. If our current suppliers were to stop selling or licensing merchandise, content, compon
ents, or services to us on acceptable terms, or delay delivery, including as a result of one or more supplie
r bankruptcies due to poor economic conditions, as a result of natural disasters, or for other reasons, we m
ay be unable to procure alternatives from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on acceptable
 terms, or at all. In addition, if our suppliers or other vendors violate applicable laws, regulations, our 
code of standards and responsibilities, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous t
o the environment, it could damage our reputation, limit our growth, and negatively affect our operating res
ults.  We May Be Subject to Risks Related to Government Contracts and Related Procurement Regulations Our co
ntracts with U.S., as well as state, local, and foreign, government entities are subject to various procurem
ent regulations and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. We may 
be subject to audits and investigations relating to our government contracts, and any violations could resul
t in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contract, r
efunding or suspending of payments, forfeiture of profits, payment of fines, and suspension or debarment fro
m future government business. In addition, such contracts may provide for termination by the government at a
ny time, without cause. We May Be Subject to Product Liability Claims if People or Property Are Harmed by th
e Products We Sell or Manufacture Some of the products we sell or manufacture may expose us to product liabi
lity or food safety claims relating to personal injury or illness, death, or environmental or property damag
e, and may require product recalls or other actions. Certain third parties also sell products using our serv
ices and stores that may increase our exposure to product liability claims, such as if these sellers do not 
have sufficient protection from such claims. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain 
that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be a
vailable to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In addition, some of our agreements with our ven
dors and sellers do not indemnify us from product liability. We Are Subject to Payments-Related Risks We acc
ept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, credit accounts (including promo
tional financing), gift cards, direct debit from a customer’s bank account, consumer invoicing, physical ban
k check, and payment upon delivery. For existing and future payment options we offer to our customers, we ma
y become subject to additional regulations and compliance requirements (including obligations to implement e
nhanced authentication processes that could result in significant costs and reduce the ease of use of our pa
yments products), as well as fraud. For certain payment methods,  13  including credit and debit cards, we p
ay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitab
ility. We rely on third parties to provide certain Amazon-branded payment methods and payment processing ser
vices, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, and promotional financing. 
In each case, it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these s
ervices to us. We also offer co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating res
ults if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules, including data security
 rules, certification requirements, and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be
 reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. If we fail to comply with these rules or
 requirements, or if our data security systems are breached, compromised, or otherwise unable to detect or p
revent fraudulent activity, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher tran
saction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our customers, process elec
tronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results
 could be adversely affected.  In addition, we provide regulated services in certain jurisdictions because w
e enable customers to keep account balances with us and transfer money to third parties, and because we prov
ide services to third parties to facilitate payments on their behalf. In these jurisdictions, we may be subj
ect to requirements for licensing, regulatory inspection, bonding and capital maintenance, the use, handling
, and segregation of transferred funds, consumer disclosures, maintaining or processing data, and authentica
tion. We are also subject to or voluntarily comply with a number of other laws and regulations relating to p
ayments, money laundering, international money transfers, privacy and information security, and electronic f
und transfers. If we were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to
 additional requirements and civil and criminal penalties, or forced to cease providing certain services. We
 Could Be Liable for Fraudulent or Unlawful Activities of Sellers The law relating to the liability of onlin
e service providers is currently unsettled. In addition, governmental agencies could require changes in the 
way this business is conducted. Under our seller programs, we may be unable to prevent sellers from collecti
ng payments, fraudulently or otherwise, when buyers never receive the products they ordered or when the prod
ucts received are materially different from the sellers’ descriptions. We also may be unable to prevent sell
ers in our stores or through other stores from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated, or stolen goods, sell
ing goods in an unlawful or unethical manner, violating the proprietary rights of others, or otherwise viola
ting our policies. Under our A2Z Guarantee, we reimburse buyers for payments up to certain limits in these s
ituations, and as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negati
vely affect our operating results. In addition, to the extent any of this occurs, it could harm our business
 or damage our reputation and we could face civil or criminal liability for unlawful activities by our selle
rs.

Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within the me
aning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than statements of histo
rical fact, including statements regarding guidance, industry prospects, or future results of operations or 
financial position, made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward-looking. We use words such as antici
pates, believes, expects, future, intends, and similar expressions to identify forward-looking statements. F
orward-looking statements reflect management’s current expectations and are inherently uncertain. Actual res
ults could differ materially for a variety of reasons, including, among others, fluctuations in foreign exch
ange rates, changes in global economic conditions and customer spending, world events, the rate of growth of
 the Internet, online commerce, and cloud services, the amount that Amazon.com invests in new business oppor
tunities and the timing of those investments, the mix of products and services sold to customers, the mix of
 net sales derived from products as compared with services, the extent to which we owe income or other taxes
, competition, management of growth, potential fluctuations in operating results, international growth and e
xpansion, the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims, fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data center op
timization, risks of inventory management, seasonality, the degree to which we enter into, maintain, and dev
elop commercial agreements, proposed and completed acquisitions and strategic transactions, payments risks, 
and risks of fulfillment throughput and productivity. In addition, the current global economic climate ampli
fies many of these risks. These risks and uncertainties, as well as other risks and uncertainties that could
 cause our actual results to differ significantly from management’s expectations, are described in greater d
etail in Item 1A of Part I, “Risk Factors.” Overview . The products offered through our stores include merch
andise and content we have purchased for resale and products offered by third-party sellers, and we also man
ufacture and sell electronic devices. Generally, we recognize gross revenue from items we sell from our inve
ntory as product sales and recognize our net share of revenue of items sold by third-party sellers as servic
e sales. We seek to increase unit sales across our stores, through increased product selection, across numer
ous product categories. We also offer other services such as compute, storage, and database offerings, fulfi
llment, publishing, digital content subscriptions, and advertising.  Free cash flows are driven primarily by
 increasing operating income and efficiently managing working capital 2  and cash capital expenditures, incl
uding our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment. Increases in operating income primarily resu
lt from increases in sales of products and services and efficiently managing our operating costs, partially 
offset by investments we make in longer-term strategic initiatives. To increase sales of products and servic
es, we focus on improving all aspects of the customer experience, including lowering prices, improving avail
ability, offering faster delivery and performance times, increasing selection, increasing product categories
 and service offerings, expanding product information, improving ease of use, improving reliability, and ear
ning customer trust.   Our variable costs include product and content costs, payment processing and related 
transaction costs, picking, packaging, and preparing orders for shipment, transportation, customer service s
upport, costs necessary to run AWS, and a portion of our marketing costs. Our fixed costs include the costs 
necessary to build and run our technology infrastructure; to build, enhance, and add features to our online 
stores, web services, electronic devices, and digital offerings; and to build and optimize our fulfillment c
enters and other facilities. Variable costs generally change directly with sales volume, while fixed costs g
enerally are dependent on the timing of capacity needs, geographic expansion, category expansion, and other 
factors. To decrease our variable costs on a per unit basis and enable us to lower prices for customers, we 
seek to increase our direct sourcing, increase discounts from suppliers, and reduce defects in our processes
. To minimize growth in fixed costs, we seek to improve process efficiencies and maintain a lean culture.   
    _______________________ (1) See “Results of Operations — Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below for addition
al information on our non-GAAP free cash flows financial measures. (2) Working capital consists of accounts 
receivable, inventory, and accounts payable. 18   On average, our high inventory velocity means we generally
 collect from consumers before our payments to suppliers come due. We expect variability in inventory turnov
er over time since it is affected by numerous factors, including our product mix, the mix of sales by us and
 by third-party sellers, our continuing focus on in-stock inventory availability and selection of product of
ferings, our investment in new geographies and product lines, and the extent to which we choose to utilize t
hird-party fulfillment providers. We also expect some variability in accounts payable days over time since t
hey are affected by several factors, including the mix of product sales, the mix of sales by third-party sel
lers, the mix of suppliers, seasonality, and changes in payment terms over time, including the effect of bal
ancing pricing and timing of payment terms with suppliers.  We believe that advances in technology, specific
ally the speed and reduced cost of processing power and the advances of wireless connectivity, will continue
 to improve the consumer experience on the Internet and increase its ubiquity in people’s lives. To best tak
e advantage of these continued advances in technology, we are investing in initiatives to build and deploy i
nnovative and efficient software and electronic devices. We are also investing in AWS, which offers a broad 
set of global compute, storage, database, and other service offerings to developers and enterprises of all s
izes.  We utilize restricted stock units as our primary vehicle for equity compensation because we believe t
his compensation model aligns the long-term interests of our shareholders and employees. In measuring shareh
older dilution, we include all vested and unvested stock awards outstanding, without regard to estimated for
feitures. Total shares outstanding plus outstanding stock awards were  504 million  and  507 million  as of 
 December 31, 2017  and  2018 . . For example, if the U.S. Dollar weakens year-over-year relative to currenc
ies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be higher than if
 currencies had remained constant. Likewise, if the U.S. Dollar strengthens year-over-year relative to curre
ncies in our international locations, our consolidated net sales and operating expenses will be lower than i
f currencies had remained constant. We believe that our increasing diversification beyond the U.S. economy t
hrough our growing international businesses benefits our shareholders over the long-term. We also believe it
 is useful to evaluate our operating results and growth rates before and after the effect of currency change
s. In addition, the remeasurement of our intercompany balances can result in significant gains and losses as
sociated with the effect of movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Currency volatilities may continue
, which may significantly impact (either positively or negatively) our reported results and consolidated tre
nds and comparisons. For additional information about each line item addressed above, refer to Item 8 of Par
t II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policie
s.”                 _______________________ (3) The operating cycle is the number of days of sales in invent
ory plus the number of days of sales in accounts receivable minus accounts payable days. 19  Critical Accoun
ting Judgments The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting prin
ciples of the United States (“GAAP”) requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the cons
olidated financial statements and accompanying notes. The SEC has defined a company’s critical accounting po
licies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company’s financial condition and results
 of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as 
a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, w
e have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We also have other key acc
ounting policies, which involve the use of estimates, judgments, and assumptions that are significant to und
erstanding our results. For additional information, see Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplem
entary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Although we believe that our estima
tes, assumptions, and judgments are reasonable, they are based upon information presently available. Actual 
results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions, judgments, or conditions.
 Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first-in firs
t-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires us to ma
ke judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, such as thro
ugh sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recoverable val
ues of each disposition category. These assumptions about future disposition of inventory are inherently unc
ertain and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the futu
re. As a measure of sensitivity, for every 1% of additional inventory valuation allowance as of  , we would 
have recorded an additional cost of sales of approximately $190 million. In addition, we enter into supplier
 commitments for certain electronic device components and certain products. These commitments are based on f
orecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additional costs. We are subject to 
income taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Tax laws, regulations, admi
nistrative practices, principles, and interpretations in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant
 change, with or without notice, due to economic, political, and other conditions, and significant judgment 
is required in evaluating and estimating our provision and accruals for these taxes. There are many transact
ions that occur during the ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain
. Our effective tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, such as changes in our business operations,
 acquisitions, investments, entry into new businesses and geographies, intercompany transactions, the relati
ve amount of our foreign earnings, including earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we
 have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rate
s, losses incurred in jurisdictions for which we are not able to realize related tax benefits, the applicabi
lity of special tax regimes, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in our stock price, changes
 in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, changes in the laws, regulations, administr
ative practices, principles, and interpretations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framewo
rk, competition, and other laws and accounting rules in various jurisdictions. In addition, a number of coun
tries are actively pursuing changes to their tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals, such as the U.
S. tax reform legislation commonly known as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “U.S. Tax Act”). Fin
ally, foreign governments may enact tax laws in response to the U.S. Tax Act that could result in further ch
anges to global taxation and materially affect our financial position and results of operations. The U.S. Ta
x Act significantly changed how the U.S. taxes corporations. The U.S. Tax Act requires complex computations 
to be performed that were not previously required by U.S. tax law, significant judgments to be made in inter
pretation of the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, significant estimates in calculations, and the preparation 
and analysis of information not previously relevant or regularly produced. The U.S. Treasury Department, the
 IRS, and other standard-setting bodies will continue to interpret or issue guidance on how provisions of th
e U.S. Tax Act will be applied or otherwise administered. As future guidance is issued, we may make adjustme
nts to amounts that we have previously recorded that may materially impact our provision for income taxes in
 the period in which the adjustments are made. We are also currently subject to tax controversies in various
 jurisdictions, and these jurisdictions may assess additional income tax liabilities against us. Development
s in an audit, investigation, or other tax controversy could have a material effect on our operating results
 or cash flows in the period or periods for which that development occurs, as well as for prior and subseque
nt periods. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these proceedings to det
ermine the adequacy of our tax accruals. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final out
come of audits, investigations, and any other tax controversies could be materially different from our histo
rical income tax provisions and accruals. 20  See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary
 Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash flow
 information, which reflects retrospective adjustments to our consolidated statements of cash flows as descr
ibed in Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business a
nd Accounting Policies,” is as follows (in millions):       Year Ended December 31,   2016   2017   2018 Cas
h provided by (used in):           Operating activities $ 17,203    $ 18,365    $ 30,723  Investing activiti
es (9,516 )   (27,084 )   (12,369 ) Financing activities (3,716 )   9,928    (7,686 ) Our principal sources 
of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securit
ies balances, which, at fair value, were $ 26.0 billion ,  $31.0 billion , and  $41.3 billion  as of  Decemb
er 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Amounts held in foreign currencies were  $9.1 billion ,  $11.1 billion , a
nd  $13.8 billion , as of  December 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , and were primarily Euros, British Pounds,
 and Japanese Yen. Cash  provided by (used in)  operating activities was  $17.2 billion ,  $18.4 billion , a
nd  $30.7 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash receiv
ed from our consumer, seller, developer, enterprise, and content creator customers, and advertisers, offset 
by cash payments we make for products and services, employee compensation, payment processing and related tr
ansaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments on our long-term obligations. Cash received from ou
r customers and other activities generally corresponds to our net sales. Because consumers primarily use cre
dit cards to buy from us, our receivables from consumers settle quickly. The  increase  in operating cash fl
ow in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to the increase in net inc
ome, excluding non-cash charges such as depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation. Cash  prov
ided by (used in)  operating activities is also subject to changes in working capital. Working capital at an
y specific point in time is subject to many variables, including seasonality, inventory management and categ
ory expansion, the timing of cash receipts and payments, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations in foreign e
xchange rates. Cash  provided by (used in)  investing activities corresponds with cash capital expenditures,
 including leasehold improvements, incentives received from property and equipment vendors, cash outlays for
 acquisitions, investments in other companies and intellectual property rights, and purchases, sales, and ma
turities of marketable securities. Cash  provided by (used in)  investing activities was  $(9.5) billion ,  
$(27.1) billion , and  $(12.4) billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , with the variability caused primarily
 by cash paid for acquisitions, our decision to purchase or lease property and equipment, and purchases, mat
urities, and sales of marketable securities. Cash capital expenditures were $ 6.7 billion , $ 10.1 billion ,
 and  $11.3 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , which primarily reflect additional capacity to support o
ur fulfillment operations and additional investments in support of continued business growth in technology i
nfrastructure (the majority of which is to support AWS), during all three years. In  2016 ,  2017 , and  201
8 , we made cash payments, net of acquired cash, related to acquisition and other investment activity of  $1
16 million ,  $14.0 billion , and  $2.2 billion . Cash  provided by (used in)  financing activities was  $(3
.7) billion ,  $9.9 billion , and  $(7.7) billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Cash outflows from financi
ng activities result from principal repayments on obligations related to capital leases and finance leases a
nd repayments of long-term debt and other, which were  $4.3 billion ,  $6.3 billion , and  $8.5 billion  in 
 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Property and equipment acquired under capital leases was  $5.7 billion ,  $9.6 b
illion , and  $10.6 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , with the  increase  reflecting investments in su
pport of continued business growth primarily due to investments in technology infrastructure for AWS, which 
investments we expect to continue over time. Cash inflows from financing activities primarily result from pr
oceeds from long-term debt and other. Proceeds from long-term debt and other were  $618 million ,  $16.2 bil
lion , and  $768 million  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . During 2017, cash inflows from financing activities
 consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of $16.0 billion of senior unsecured notes in seven tranc
hes maturing in 2020 through 2057. The proceeds from notes issued in August 2017 (the “August 2017 Notes”) w
ere used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, an
d for general corporate purposes.  21  In April 2018, we established a commercial paper program (the “Commer
cial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commercial paper up to a total of 
 $7.0 billion  at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not exceed  397 days  from the
 date of issue. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of  December 31, 
2018 . We had no borrowings outstanding under our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement
”) and  $594 million  of borrowings outstanding under our  $620 million  secured revolving credit facility (
the “Credit Facility”) as of  December 31, 2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and Supplemen
tary Data — Note 5 — Debt” for additional information.  In  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , we recorded net tax p
rovisions of  $1.4 billion ,  $769 million , and  $1.2 billion . Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are sub
ject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriatio
n of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as ou
r capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we w
ould incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts. As of  December 31, 2018 , cash,
 cash equivalents, and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries was $12.0 billion. We have tax ben
efits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that ar
e being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. The U.S. Tax Act enhanced and extended the option to cla
im accelerated depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment
, through 2022. Cash taxes paid (net of refunds) were  $412 million ,  $957 million , and  $1.2 billion  for
  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . As of  December 31, 2018 , our federal net operating loss carryforward was appr
oximately  $627 million  and we had approximately  $1.4 billion  of federal tax credits potentially availabl
e to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credits are primarily related to the U.S. federal resear
ch and development credit. As we utilize our federal net operating losses and tax credits we expect cash pai
d for taxes to increase. We endeavor to manage our global taxes on a cash basis, rather than on a financial 
reporting basis. In connection with the European Commission’s October 2017 decision against us on state aid,
 Luxembourg tax authorities computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission’s d
ecision, of approximately €250 million, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment p
ending conclusion of all appeals.  Our liquidity is also affected by restricted cash balances that are pledg
ed as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, 
and standby and trade letters of credit. To the extent we process payments for third-party sellers or offer 
certain types of stored value to our customers, some jurisdictions may restrict our use of those funds. Thes
e restrictions would result in the reclassification of a portion of our cash and cash equivalents from “Cash
 and cash equivalents” to restricted cash, which is classified within “Accounts receivable, net and other” o
n our consolidated balance sheets. As of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , restricted cash, cash equivalents, 
and marketable securities were  $1.3 billion  and  $426 million . See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statemen
ts and Supplementary Data — Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies” for additional discussion of our princip
al contractual commitments, as well as our pledged assets. Additionally, purchase obligations and open purch
ase orders, consisting of inventory and significant non-inventory commitments, were  $13.1 billion  as of  D
ecember 31, 2018 . These purchase obligations and open purchase orders are generally cancellable in full or 
in part through the contractual provisions. We believe that cash flows generated from operations and our cas
h, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, as well as our borrowing arrangements, will be suff
icient to meet our anticipated operating cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any projection
s of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Item 1A of Part I, “Risk F
actors.” We continually evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities, obtain credit f
acilities, obtain capital, finance, and operating lease arrangements, repurchase common stock, pay dividends
, or repurchase, refinance, or otherwise restructure our debt for strategic reasons or to further strengthen
 our financial position.  The sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities would likely be dilut
ive to our shareholders. In addition, we will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of, or investment
 in, complementary businesses, products, services, capital infrastructure, and technologies, which might aff
ect our liquidity requirements or cause us to secure additional financing, or issue additional equity or deb
t securities. There can be no assurance that additional credit lines or financing instruments will be availa
ble in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all.  22  Results of Operations We have organized our ope
rations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. Our results reflect the operations of Wh
ole Foods Market from the date of acquisition in August 2017. These segments reflect the way the Company eva
luates its business performance and manages its operations. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financial Statements and
 Supplementary Data — Note 10 — Segment Information.”  Net sales include product and service sales. Product 
sales represent revenue from the sale of products and related shipping fees and digital media content where 
we record revenue gross. Service sales primarily represent third-party seller fees, which includes commissio
ns and any related fulfillment and shipping fees, AWS sales, Amazon Prime membership fees, advertising servi
ces, and certain digital content subscriptions. Net sales information is as follows (in millions):     Year

s impacted net sales by  $(550) million ,  $210 million , and  $1.3 billion  for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 .
 For a discussion of the effect on sales growth of foreign exchange rates, see “Effect of Foreign Exchange R
ates” below. North America sales  increased   33%  in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior ye
ars. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects increased unit sales, including sales by third-party s
ellers, and the impact of the acquisition of Whole Foods Market. Increased unit sales were driven largely by
 our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-
stock inventory availability, and increased selection. International sales  increased   23%  and  21%  in  2
017 , and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales growth in each year primarily reflects i
ncreased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers. Increased unit sales were driven largely by our
 continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers, including from our shipping offers, increased in-stoc
k inventory availability, and increased selection. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates impacted Inter
national net sales by  $(489) million ,  $138 million , and  $1.3 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 .  A
WS sales  increased   43 % and  47 % in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years. The sales
 growth in each year primarily reflects increased customer usage, partially offset by pricing changes. Prici
ng changes were driven largely by our continued efforts to reduce prices for our customers. 23    Operating 
income (loss) by segment is as follows (in millions):   Year Ended December 31,   2016   2017   2018 Operati
ng Income (Loss):           North America $ 2,361    $ 2,837    $ 7,267  International (1,283 )   (3,062 )  
 (2,142 ) AWS 3,108    4,331    7,296  Consolidated $ 4,186   $ 4,106   $ 12,421  Operating income was  $4.2
 billion ,  $4.1 billion , and  $12.4 billion  for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . We believe that operating inc
ome (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our produ
ct categories and services. The  increase  in North America operating income in absolute dollars in  2017  a
nd  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased unit sales, including sales
 by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower growth in certain operating expenses, partially offse
t by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by
  $27 million ,  $(4) million , and  $17 million  for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 .  The  decrease  in Interna
tional operating loss in absolute dollars in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is p
rimarily due to increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, advertising sales, and slower 
growth in certain operating expenses, partially offset by costs to expand our fulfillment network. Changes i
n foreign exchange rates impacted operating loss by  $89 million ,  $(85) million , and  $258 million  for  
2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 .  The  increase  in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in  2017  and  2018 ,
 compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure pro
ductivity, partially offset by pricing changes and increased spending on technology infrastructure and payro
ll and related expenses, which was primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth
. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by  $(5) million ,  $(53) million , and  $(49)
 million  for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . 24  Information about operating expenses is as follows (in million

imarily consists of the purchase price of consumer products, digital media content costs where we record rev
enue gross, including video and music, packaging supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipm
ent costs, and inbound and outbound shipping costs, including where we are the transportation service provid
er.  The  increase  in cost of sales in absolute dollars in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable pr
ior years, is primarily due to increased product and shipping costs resulting from increased sales. Shipping
 costs to receive products from our suppliers are included in our inventory and recognized as cost of sales 
upon sale of products to our customers. Shipping costs, which include sortation and delivery centers and tra
nsportation costs, were  $16.2 billion ,  $21.7 billion , and  $27.7 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 .
 We expect our cost of shipping to continue to increase to the extent our customers accept and use our shipp
ing offers at an increasing rate, we reduce shipping rates, we use more expensive shipping methods, and we o
ffer additional services. We seek to mitigate costs of shipping over time in part through achieving higher s
ales volumes, optimizing our fulfillment network, negotiating better terms with our suppliers, and achieving
 better operating efficiencies. We believe that offering low prices to our customers is fundamental to our f
uture success, and one way we offer lower prices is through shipping offers. Costs to operate our AWS segmen
t are primarily classified as “Technology and content” as we leverage a shared infrastructure that supports 
both our internal technology requirements and external sales to AWS customers. 25  Fulfillment costs primari
ly consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International fulfillment
 centers, customer service centers, and physical stores and payment processing costs. While AWS payment proc
essing and related transaction costs are included in fulfillment, AWS costs are primarily classified as “Tec
hnology and content.” Fulfillment costs as a percentage of net sales may vary due to several factors, such a
s payment processing and related transaction costs, our level of productivity and accuracy, changes in volum
e, size, and weight of units received and fulfilled, timing of fulfillment network and physical store expans
ion, the extent we utilize fulfillment services provided by third parties, mix of products and services sold
, and our ability to affect customer service contacts per unit by implementing improvements in our operation
s and enhancements to our customer self-service features. Additionally, because payment processing and fulfi
llment costs associated with seller transactions are based on the gross purchase price of underlying transac
tions, and payment processing and related transaction and fulfillment costs are higher as a percentage of sa
les versus our retail sales, sales by our sellers have higher fulfillment costs as a percent of net sales. T
he  increase  in fulfillment costs in absolute dollars in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prio
r years, is primarily due to costs from expanding our fulfillment network, which includes physical stores, a
nd variable costs corresponding with increased product and service sales volume and inventory levels. We see
k to expand our fulfillment network to accommodate a greater selection and in-stock inventory levels and to 
meet anticipated shipment volumes from sales of our own products as well as sales by third parties for which
 we provide the fulfillment services. We regularly evaluate our facility requirements. We direct customers t
o our stores primarily through a number of targeted online marketing channels, such as our sponsored search,
 third party customer referrals, social and online advertising, television advertising, and other initiative
s. Our marketing costs are largely variable, based on growth in sales and changes in rates. To the extent th
ere is increased or decreased competition for these traffic sources, or to the extent our mix of these chann
els shifts, we would expect to see a corresponding change in our marketing costs. The  increase  in marketin
g costs in absolute dollars in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due t
o payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, as well as increas
ed spending on online marketing channels. While costs associated with Amazon Prime memberships and other shi
pping offers are not included in marketing expense, we view these offers as effective worldwide marketing to
ols, and intend to continue offering them indefinitely. Technology and content costs include payroll and rel
ated expenses for employees involved in the research and development of new and existing products and servic
es, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and display of products and services made a
vailable in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure costs include servers, networking eq
uipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and other expenses necessary to support AWS 
and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the investments we make in order to offer a w
ide variety of products and services to our customers. We seek to invest efficiently in numerous areas of te
chnology and content so we may continue to enhance the customer experience and improve our process efficienc
y through rapid technology developments, while operating at an ever increasing scale. Our technology and con
tent investment and capital spending projects often support a variety of product and service offerings due t
o geographic expansion and the cross-functionality of our systems and operations. We expect spending in tech
nology and content to increase over time as we continue to add employees and technology infrastructure. Thes
e costs are allocated to segments based on usage. The  increase  in technology and content costs in absolute
 dollars in  2017  and  2018 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to an increase in sp
ending on technology infrastructure and increased payroll and related costs associated with technical teams 
responsible for expanding our existing products and services and initiatives to introduce new products and s
ervice offerings. The  increase  in general and administrative costs in absolute dollars in  2017  and  2018
 , compared to the comparable prior years, is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses. 26
  Other operating expense, net was  $167 million ,  $214 million , and  $296 million  during  2016 ,  2017 ,
 and  2018 , and is primarily related to the amortization of intangible assets. Our interest income was  $10
0 million ,  $202 million , and  $440 million  during  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . We generally invest our ex
cess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income secu
rities. Our interest income corresponds with the average balance of invested funds based on the prevailing r
ates, which vary depending on the geographies and currencies in which they are invested. Interest expense wa
s  $484 million ,  $848 million , and  $1.4 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . The  increase  is primar
ily due to increases in our long-term debt and capital and finance lease arrangements. Our long-term debt wa
s  $24.7 billion  and  $23.5 billion  as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . Our other long-term liabilities 
were  $21.0 billion  and  $27.2 billion  as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . See Item 8 of Part II, “Finan
cial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 5 — Debt and Note 6 — Other Long-Term Liabilities” for additio
nal information. Other income (expense), net was  $90 million ,  $346 million , and  $(183) million  during 
 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . The primary components of other income (expense), net are related to foreign cur
rency, equity warrant valuation, and equity securities gains. Our effective tax rate is subject to significa
nt variation due to several factors, including variability in our pre-tax and taxable income and loss and th
e mix of jurisdictions to which they relate, intercompany transactions, the applicability of special tax reg
imes, changes in how we do business, acquisitions, investments, audit-related developments, changes in our s
tock price, changes in our deferred tax assets and liabilities and their valuation, foreign currency gains (
losses), changes in statutes, regulations, case law, and administrative practices, principles, and interpret
ations related to tax, including changes to the global tax framework, competition, and other laws and accoun
ting rules in various jurisdictions, and relative changes of expenses or losses for which tax benefits are n
ot recognized. Additionally, our effective tax rate can be more or less volatile based on the amount of pre-
tax income or loss. For example, the impact of discrete items and non-deductible expenses on our effective t
ax rate is greater when our pre-tax income is lower.  The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2
017. The U.S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering t
he statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-ti
me tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreig
n earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelera
ted depreciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2
022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financi
al statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax 
Act of approximately $789 million. This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net d
eferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to 2
1% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign
 subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of 
the accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act.  We recorded a provision for income taxes of  $1.4 billion 
,  $769 million , and  $1.2 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Our provision for income taxes in 2017 w
as lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation and the one-time fa
vorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of foreign losses for 
which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We have recorded valuation allowances
 against the deferred tax assets associated with losses for which we may not realize a related tax benefit. 
 We regularly assess whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each
 taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, w
e review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earn
ings, capital gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax 
reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense
 of $600 million to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Our prov
ision for income taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income a
nd the one-time provisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by
 the reduction to the  27  U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign l
osses for which we may not realize a tax benefit, and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based co
mpensation. We have tax benefits relating to excess stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depr
eciation deductions that are being utilized to reduce our U.S. taxable income. As of  December 31, 2018 , ou
r federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately  $627 million  and we had approximately  $1.4 bi
llion  of federal tax credits potentially available to offset future tax liabilities. Our federal tax credit
s are primarily related to the U.S. federal research and development credit. See Item 8 of Part II, “Financi
al Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 9 — Income Taxes” for additional information. Equity-method inve
stment activity, net of tax, was  $(96) million ,  $(4) million , and  $9 million  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2
018 . The primary components of this activity during  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  were our equity-method inves
tment gains (losses) during the years and impairments recorded in 2016.  Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulat
ion G, Conditions for Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures, and other SEC regulations define and prescribe the
 conditions for use of certain non-GAAP financial information. Our measures of free cash flows and the effec
t of foreign exchange rates on our consolidated statements of operations meet the definition of non-GAAP fin
ancial measures.  We provide multiple measures of free cash flows because we believe these measures provide 
additional perspective on the impact of acquiring property and equipment with cash and through capital and f
inance leases. As a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance, we retrospectively adjusted our conso
lidated statements of cash flows to add restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents. See Item 8 of Part II,
 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 1 — Description of Business and Accounting Policies.” F
ree cash flow is cash flow from operations reduced by “Purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds 
from property and equipment incentives,” which both are included in cash flow from investing activities. The
 following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash  p
rovided by (used in)  operating activities,” for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  (in millions):   Year Ended Dece

 flow reduced by “Principal repayments of capital lease obligations,” and “Principal repayments of finance l
ease obligations,” which are included in cash flow from financing activities. Free cash flow less lease prin
cipal repayments approximates the actual payments of cash for our capital and finance leases. The following 
is a reconciliation of free cash flow less lease principal repayments to the most comparable GAAP cash flow 
measure, “Net cash  provided by (used in)  operating activities,” for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  (in million

uired under capital leases is free cash flow reduced by “Principal repayments of finance lease obligations,”
 which is included in cash flow from financing activities, and property and equipment acquired under capital
 leases. In this measure, property and equipment acquired under capital leases is reflected as if these asse
ts had been purchased with cash, which is not the case as these assets have been leased. The following is a 
reconciliation of free cash flow less finance lease principal repayments and assets acquired under capital l
eases to the most comparable GAAP cash flow measure, “Net cash  provided by (used in)  operating activities,
” for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  (in millions):   Year Ended December 31,   2016   2017   2018 Net cash prov

16 )   $ 9,928    $ (7,686 ) All of these free cash flows measures have limitations as they omit certain com
ponents of the overall cash flow statement and do not represent the residual cash flow available for discret
ionary expenditures. For example, these measures of free cash flows do not incorporate the portion of paymen
ts representing principal reductions of debt or cash payments for business acquisitions. Additionally, our m
ix of property and equipment acquisitions with cash or other financing options may change over time. Therefo
re, we believe it is important to view free cash flows measures only as a complement to our entire consolida
ted statements of cash flows. 29  Information regarding the effect of foreign exchange rates, versus the U.S

<subsection name: "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk">
We are exposed to market risk for the effect of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and ch
anges in the market values of our investments. Information relating to quantitative and qualitative disclosu
res about market risk is set forth below and in Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Interest Rate Risk Our exp
osure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our lon
g-term debt. Our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and fluctuations in interest rates do not impac
t our consolidated financial statements. However, the fair value of our debt, which pays interest at a fixed
 rate, will generally fluctuate with movements of interest rates, increasing in periods of declining rates o
f interest and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest. All of our cash equivalent and marketab
le fixed income securities are designated as available-for-sale and, accordingly, are presented at fair valu
e on our consolidated balance sheets. We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds an
d investment grade short- to intermediate-term fixed income securities. Fixed income securities may have the
ir fair market value adversely affected due to a rise in interest rates, and we may suffer losses in princip
al if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates. The fol
lowing table provides information about our cash equivalents and marketable fixed income securities, includi
ng principal cash flows by expected maturity and the related weighted-average interest rates as of   (in mil

250  Based upon quoted market prices and Level 2 inputs, the fair value of our total debt was  $25.0 billion
  as of  . Foreign Exchange Risk During  , net sales from our International segment accounted for  28%  of o
ur consolidated revenues. Net sales and related expenses generated from our internationally-focused stores, 
including within Canada and Mexico (which are included in our North America segment), are primarily denomina
ted in the functional currencies of the corresponding stores and primarily include Euros, British Pounds, an
d Japanese Yen. The results of operations of, and certain of our intercompany balances associated with, our 
internationally-focused stores and AWS are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon consolidation
, as foreign exchange rates vary, net sales and other operating results may differ materially from expectati
ons, and we may record significant gains or losses on the remeasurement of intercompany balances. For exampl
e, as a result of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates throughout the year compared to rates in effect the
 prior year, International segment net sales  increased  by  $1.3 billion  in comparison with the prior year
. We have foreign exchange risk related to foreign-denominated cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securi
ties (“foreign funds”). Based on the balance of foreign funds as of  December 31, 2018 , of  $13.8 billion ,
 an assumed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in fair value declines of $690 
million, $1.4 billion, and $2.8 billion. All cash equivalent and marketable fixed income securities are clas
sified as “available-for-sale.” Fluctuations in fair value are recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive 
loss,” a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Equity securities with readily determinable fair values
 are included in “Marketable securities” on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value w
ith changes recognized in net income. We have foreign exchange risk related to our intercompany balances den
ominated in various foreign currencies. Based on the intercompany balances as of  December 31, 2018 , an ass
umed 5%, 10%, and 20% adverse change to foreign exchange would result in losses of $145 million, $305 millio
n, and $685 million, recorded to “Other income (expense), net.” See Item 7 of Part II, “Management’s Discuss
ion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations — Effect of Foreig
n Exchange Rates” for additional information on the effect on reported results of changes in foreign exchang
e rates. 32  Investment Risk As of  , our recorded value in equity and equity warrant investments in public 
and private companies was $942 million. Our equity and equity warrant investments in publicly traded compani
es represent $518 million of our investments as of  December 31, 2018 , and are recorded at fair value, whic
h is subject to market price volatility. We perform a qualitative assessment for our equity investments in p
rivate companies to identify impairment. If this assessment indicates that an impairment exists, we estimate
 the fair value of the investment and, if the fair value is less than carrying value, we write down the inve
stment to fair value. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends, recent sales/
acquisitions of the investee securities, and other publicly available data. The current global economic clim
ate provides additional uncertainty. Valuations of private companies are inherently more complex due to the 
lack of readily available market data. As such, we believe that market sensitivities are not practicable. 33

he accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amazon.com, Inc. (the Company) as of  December 31, 2018  and 
 2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, a
nd cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended  December 31, 2018  and the related notes (col
lectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financia
l statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at  December 31
, 2018  and  2017 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the 
period ended  December 31, 2018 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  We also
 have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Sta

iteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organiza

 management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our 
audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with re
spect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regula

e standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable as
surance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fr
aud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial
 statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such proc
edures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates mad

ES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Note 1 — DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES Descriptio
n of Business We seek to be Earth’s most customer-centric company. In each of our segments, we serve our pri
mary customer sets, consisting of consumers, sellers, developers, enterprises, and content creators. We serv
e consumers through our online and physical stores and focus on selection, price, and convenience. We offer 
programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores and fulfill orders through us, and program
s that allow authors, musicians, filmmakers, skill and app developers, and others to publish and sell conten
t. We serve developers and enterprises of all sizes through our AWS segment, which offers a broad set of glo
bal compute, storage, database, and other service offerings. We also manufacture and sell electronic devices
. In addition, we provide services, such as advertising. We have organized our operations into  three  segme
nts: North America, International, and AWS. See “Note 10 — Segment Information.”  Prior Period Reclassificat
ions  Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation, inc
luding the addition of restricted cash to cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated statements of cash f
lows as a result of the adoption of new accounting guidance. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated fi
nancial statements include the accounts of Amazon.com, Inc., its wholly-owned subsidiaries, and those entiti
es in which we have a variable interest and of which we are the primary beneficiary, including certain entit
ies in India and China and that support our seller lending financing activities (collectively, the “Company”
). Intercompany balances and transactions between consolidated entities are eliminated. The financial result
s of Whole Foods Market, Inc. (“Whole Foods Market”) have been included in our consolidated financial statem
ents from the date of acquisition on August 28, 2017. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statemen
ts in conformity with GAAP requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and
 liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent liabilities in the consolidated f
inancial statements and accompanying notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, income taxes, commit
ments and contingencies, valuation of acquired intangibles and goodwill, stock-based compensation forfeiture
 rates, vendor funding, and inventory valuation. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates
. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common sh
ares. Diluted earnings per share is calculated using our weighted-average outstanding common shares includin
g the dilutive effect of stock awards as determined under the treasury stock method. In periods when we have
 a net loss, stock awards are excluded from our calculation of earnings per share as their inclusion would h
ave an antidilutive effect. The following table shows the calculation of diluted shares (in millions):     Y
ear Ended December 31,   2016   2017   2018 Shares used in computation of basic earnings per share 474    48
0    487  Total dilutive effect of outstanding stock awards 10    13    13  Shares used in computation of di
luted earnings per share 484    493    500  41  Revenue Revenue is measured based on the amount of considera
tion that we expect to receive, reduced by estimates for return allowances, promotional discounts, and rebat
es. Revenue also excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties, including sales and indirect tax
es. In arrangements where we have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to ea
ch performance obligation using the relative stand-alone selling price. We generally determine stand-alone s
elling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus a margin.  A description 
of our principal revenue generating activities is as follows:  - We offer consumer products through our onli
ne and physical stores. Revenue is recognized when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, whic
h generally occurs upon our delivery to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon delivery, to the 
customer.  - We offer programs that enable sellers to sell their products in our stores, and fulfill orders 
through us. We are not the seller of record in these transactions. The commissions and any related fulfillme
nt and shipping fees we earn from these arrangements are recognized when the services are rendered, which ge
nerally occurs upon delivery of the related products to a third-party carrier or, in the case of an Amazon d
elivery, to the customer.   - Our subscription sales include fees associated with Amazon Prime memberships a
nd access to content including audiobooks, digital video, e-books, digital music, and other non-AWS subscrip
tion services. Prime memberships provide our customers with access to an evolving suite of benefits that rep
resent a single stand-ready obligation. Subscriptions are paid for at the time of or in advance of deliverin
g the services. Revenue from such arrangements is recognized over the subscription period.  - Our AWS arrang
ements include global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services. Revenue is allocated to servi
ces using stand-alone selling prices and is primarily recognized when the customer uses these services, base
d on the quantity of services rendered, such as compute or storage capacity delivered on-demand. Certain ser
vices, including compute and database, are also offered as a fixed quantity over a specified term, for which
 revenue is recognized ratably. Sales commissions we pay in connection with contracts that exceed one year a
re capitalized and amortized over the contract term.  - Other revenue primarily includes sales of advertisin
g services, which are recognized as ads are delivered based on the number of clicks or impressions.  Return 
Allowances  Return allowances, which reduce revenue and cost of sales, are estimated using historical experi
ence. Liabilities for return allowances are included in “Accrued expenses and other” and were  $567 million 
,  $468 million , and  $623 million  as of  December 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Additions to the allowan
ce were  $1.5 billion ,  $1.8 billion , and  $2.3 billion  and deductions from the allowance were  $1.5 bill
ion ,  $1.9 billion , and  $2.3 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Included in “Inventories” on our con
solidated balance sheets are assets totaling  $411 million ,  $406 million , and  $519 million  as of  Decem
ber 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , for the rights to recover products from customers associated with our lia
bilities for return allowances.  Cost of Sales Cost of sales primarily consists of the purchase price of con
sumer products, digital media content costs where we record revenue gross, including video and music, packag
ing supplies, sortation and delivery centers and related equipment costs, and inbound and outbound shipping 
costs, including where we are the transportation service provider. Shipping costs to receive products from o
ur suppliers are included in our inventory, and recognized as cost of sales upon sale of products to our cus
tomers. Payment processing and related transaction costs, including those associated with seller transaction
s, are classified in “Fulfillment” on our consolidated statements of operations. Vendor Agreements We have a
greements with our vendors to receive funds primarily for cooperative marketing efforts, promotions, incenti
ves, and volume rebates. We generally consider these amounts received from vendors to be a reduction of the 
prices we pay for their goods, including property and equipment, or services, and are recorded as a reductio
n of the cost of inventory, cost of services, or cost of property and equipment. Volume rebates typically de
pend on reaching minimum purchase thresholds. We evaluate the likelihood of reaching purchase thresholds usi
ng past experience and current year forecasts. When volume rebates can be reasonably estimated, we record a 
portion of the rebate as we make progress towards the purchase threshold. 42  Fulfillment Fulfillment costs 
primarily consist of those costs incurred in operating and staffing our North America and International segm
ents’ fulfillment centers, customer service centers, and physical stores, including costs attributable to bu
ying, receiving, inspecting, and warehousing inventories; picking, packaging, and preparing customer orders 
for shipment; payment processing and related transaction costs, including costs associated with our guarante
e for certain seller transactions; responding to inquiries from customers; and supply chain management for o
ur manufactured electronic devices. Fulfillment costs also include amounts paid to third parties that assist
 us in fulfillment and customer service operations. Marketing Marketing costs primarily consist of targeted 
online advertising, payroll and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and selling activities, 
and television advertising. We pay commissions to third parties when their customer referrals result in sale
s. We also participate in cooperative advertising arrangements with certain of our vendors, and other third 
parties. Advertising and other promotional costs to market our products and services are expensed as incurre
d and were  $5.0 billion ,  $6.3 billion , and  $8.2 billion  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Prepaid adverti
sing costs were not significant as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . Technology and Content Technology and 
content costs include payroll and related expenses for employees involved in the research and development of
 new and existing products and services, development, design, and maintenance of our stores, curation and di
splay of products and services made available in our online stores, and infrastructure costs. Infrastructure
 costs include servers, networking equipment, and data center related depreciation, rent, utilities, and oth
er expenses necessary to support AWS and other Amazon businesses. Collectively, these costs reflect the inve
stments we make in order to offer a wide variety of products and services to our customers. Technology and c
ontent costs are generally expensed as incurred. General and Administrative General and administrative expen
ses primarily consist of payroll and related expenses; facilities and equipment expenses, such as depreciati
on expense and rent; professional fees and litigation costs; and other general corporate costs for corporate
 functions, including accounting, finance, tax, legal, and human resources, among others. Stock-Based Compen
sation Compensation cost for all stock awards expected to vest is measured at fair value on the date of gran
t and recognized over the service period. The fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on th
e number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock. Such value is recognized as expense ove
r the service period, net of estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method. The estimated number of st
ock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and to the extent actual results or updated estimate
s differ from our current estimates, such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period 
estimates are revised. We consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including historical f
orfeiture experience and employee level. Other Operating Expense, Net Other operating expense, net, consists
 primarily of marketing-related, contract-based, and customer-related intangible asset amortization expense,
 and expenses related to legal settlements. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense), net, consist
s primarily of foreign currency gains (losses) of  $21 million ,  $247 million , and  $(206) million  in  20
16 ,  2017 , and  2018  and equity warrant valuation gains (losses) of  $67 million ,  $109 million , and  $
(131) million  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  and equity securities gains of  $1 million ,  $18 million , and
  $145 million  in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . 43  Income Taxes Income tax expense includes U.S. (federal an
d state) and foreign income taxes. Certain foreign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under th
e U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxation on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend
 to invest substantially all of our foreign subsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsi
diaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in those jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additi
onal costs upon repatriation of such amounts.   Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporar
y differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and are stated at e
nacted tax rates expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered. Deferred tax assets are
 evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe they will no
t be realized. We consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of our deferred 
tax assets, including our recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gai
ns and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes
, and other relevant factors. We utilize a two-step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain income t
ax positions (tax contingencies). The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determin
ing if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not the position will be sustained 
on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the
 tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.
 We consider many factors when evaluating our tax positions and estimating our tax benefits, which may requi
re periodic adjustments and which may not accurately forecast actual outcomes. We include interest and penal
ties related to our tax contingencies in income tax expense. Fair Value of Financial Instruments Fair value 
is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderl
y transaction between market participants at the measurement date. To increase the comparability of fair val
ue measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs to valuation methodologies used to measure fair 
value: Level 1 —  Valuations based on quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities in active markets. 
Level 2 —  Valuations based on observable inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1, such as quote
d prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets
 and liabilities in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated 
by observable market data. Level 3 —  Valuations based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions
, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made by other market participants. These valuations requi
re significant judgment. For our cash, cash equivalents, or marketable securities, we measure the fair value
 of money market funds and equity securities based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets o
r liabilities. All other financial instruments were valued either based on recent trades of securities in in
active markets or based on quoted market prices of similar instruments and other significant inputs derived 
from or corroborated by observable market data. We did not hold any cash, cash equivalents, or marketable se
curities categorized as Level 3 assets as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . As part of entering into commer
cial agreements, we often obtain equity warrant assets giving us the right to acquire stock of other compani
es. As of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , these warrants had a fair value of  $441 million  and  $440 millio
n , and are recorded within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. The related gain (loss) recor
ded in “Other income (expense), net” was  $67 million ,  $109 million , and  $(131) million  in  2016 ,  201
7 , and  2018 . These assets are primarily classified as Level 2 assets.  Cash and Cash Equivalents We class
ify all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents. Inv
entories Inventories, consisting of products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first
-in, first-out method, and are valued at the lower of cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires
 us to make judgments, based on currently available information, about the likely method of disposition, suc
h as through sales to individual customers, returns to product vendors, or liquidations, and expected recove
rable values of each disposition category.  We provide Fulfillment by Amazon services in connection with cer
tain of our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership of their inventory, regardless of whet
her fulfillment is provided by us or the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included 
in our inventories. 44  We also purchase electronic device components from a variety of suppliers and use se
veral contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal course of
 business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate supply, we enter into agreem
ents with contract manufacturers and suppliers for certain electronic device components. A portion of our re
ported purchase commitments arising from these agreements consists of firm, non-cancellable commitments. The
se commitments are based on forecasted customer demand. If we reduce these commitments, we may incur additio
nal costs. We also have firm, non-cancellable commitments for certain products offered in our Whole Foods Ma
rket stores.  Accounts Receivable, Net and Other Included in “Accounts receivable, net and other” on our con
solidated balance sheets are amounts primarily related to customers, vendors, and sellers. As of  December 3
1, 2017  and  2018 , customer receivables, net, were  $6.4 billion  and  $9.4 billion , vendor receivables, 
net, were  $2.6 billion  and  $3.2 billion , and seller receivables, net, were  $692 million  and  $710 mill
ion . Seller receivables are amounts due from sellers related to our seller lending program, which provides 
funding to sellers primarily to procure inventory. We estimate losses on receivables based on known troubled
 accounts and historical experience of losses incurred. Receivables are considered impaired and written-off 
when it is probable that all contractual payments due will not be collected in accordance with the terms of 
the agreement. The allowance for doubtful accounts was  $237 million ,  $348 million , and  $495 million  as
 of  December 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Additions to the allowance were  $451 million ,  $626 million ,
 and  $878 million , and deductions to the allowance were  $403 million ,  $515 million , and  $731 million 
 in  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . Software Development Costs We incur software development costs related to pr
oducts to be sold, leased, or marketed to external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software 
development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those
 related to design or maintenance, are expensed as incurred.  Property and Equipment, Net Property and equip
ment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Incentives that we receive from property and equipmen
t vendors are recorded as a reduction in our costs. Property includes buildings and land that we own, along 
with property we have acquired under build-to-suit, finance, and capital lease arrangements. Equipment inclu
des assets such as servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment.  Depr
eciation is recorded on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  (generally the 
lesser of  40 years  or the remaining life of the underlying building,  three years  for our servers,  five 
years  for networking equipment,  ten years  for heavy equipment, and  three  to  seven years  for other ful
fillment equipment). Depreciation expense is classified within the corresponding operating expense categorie
s on our consolidated statements of operations. Leases and Asset Retirement Obligations We categorize leases
 at their inception as either operating or capital leases. On certain of our lease agreements, we may receiv
e rent holidays and other incentives provided by the landlord. We recognize lease costs on a straight-line b
asis without regard to deferred payment terms, such as rent holidays, that defer the commencement date of re
quired payments. Additionally, incentives we receive are treated as a reduction of our costs over the term o
f the agreement. Leasehold improvements are capitalized at cost and amortized over the lesser of their expec
ted useful life or the non-cancellable term of the lease. We establish assets and liabilities for the estima
ted construction costs incurred under build-to-suit lease arrangements to the extent we are involved in the 
construction of structural improvements or take construction risk prior to commencement of a lease. Upon occ
upancy of facilities under build-to-suit leases, we assess whether these arrangements qualify for sales reco
gnition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidance. If we continue to be the deemed owner, the facilities 
are accounted for as finance leases. We establish assets and liabilities for the present value of estimated 
future costs to retire long-lived assets at the termination or expiration of a lease. Such assets are deprec
iated over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted to the future 
value of the estimated retirement costs. As disclosed in “Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted,” our ac
counting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019. 45  Goodwill We evaluate goodw
ill for impairment annually or more frequently when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate th
e carrying value may not be recoverable. In testing goodwill for impairment, we may elect to utilize a quali
tative assessment to evaluate whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is 
less than its carrying amount. If our qualitative assessment indicates that goodwill impairment is more like
ly than not, we perform a two-step impairment test. We test goodwill for impairment under the two-step impai
rment test by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the reporting units. If the 
fair value is determined to be less than the book value or qualitative factors indicate that it is more like
ly than not that goodwill is impaired, a second step is performed to compute the amount of impairment as the
 difference between the estimated fair value of goodwill and the carrying value. We estimate the fair value 
of the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best est
imate of future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily on expected category expansion, pricing, m
arket segment share, and general economic conditions.  We completed the required annual testing of goodwill 
for impairment for all reporting units as of April 1,  2018 , and determined that goodwill is  no t impaired
 as the fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their book value. There were no events that
 caused us to update our annual impairment test. See “Note 4 — Acquisitions, Goodwill, and Acquired Intangib
le Assets.” Other Assets Included in “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets are amounts primarily
 related to acquired intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization; video and music content, net of acc
umulated amortization; long-term deferred tax assets; certain equity investments; marketable securities rest
ricted for longer than one year, the majority of which are attributable to collateralization of bank guarant
ees and debt related to our international operations; and equity warrant assets. Video and Music Content We 
obtain video and music content for customers through licensing agreements that have a wide range of licensin
g provisions, which include both fixed and variable payment schedules. When the license fee for a specific m
ovie, television, or music title is determinable or reasonably estimable and the content is available for st
reaming, we recognize an asset representing the fee and a corresponding liability for the amounts owed. We r
elieve the liability as payments are made and we amortize the asset to “Cost of sales” on a straight-line ba
sis or on an accelerated basis, based on estimated usage patterns, which typically ranges from  one  to  fiv
e  years. If we are unable to reasonably estimate the cost per title, no asset or liability is recorded and 
licensing costs are expensed as incurred. We also develop original content. Capitalized production costs ass
ociated with our original content are limited by the amount of revenue we expect to earn, which results in a
 portion being expensed as incurred. These capitalized costs are amortized to “Cost of sales” on an accelera
ted basis that follows the viewing pattern of customer streams in the first months after availability.  Inve
stments We generally invest our excess cash in AAA-rated money market funds and investment grade short- to i
ntermediate-term fixed income securities. Such investments are included in “Cash and cash equivalents” or “M
arketable securities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Marketable debt securities are classi
fied as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in “Accumula
ted other comprehensive loss.” Equity investments are accounted for using the equity method of accounting if
 the investment gives us the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. E
quity-method investments are included within “Other assets” on our consolidated balance sheets. Our share of
 the earnings or losses as reported by equity-method investees, amortization of basis differences, and relat
ed gains or losses, if any, are classified as “Equity method investment activity, net of tax” on our consoli
dated statements of operations.  Equity investments without readily determinable fair values and for which w
e do not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost with adjustments for o
bservable changes in prices or impairments and are classified as “Other assets” on our consolidated balance 
sheets.  Equity investments that have readily determinable fair values are included in “Marketable securitie
s” on our consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes recognized in “Other income (e
xpense), net” on our consolidated statement of operations. We periodically evaluate whether declines in fair
 values of our investments indicate impairment. For debt securities and equity method investments, we also e
valuate whether declines in fair value of our investments below their book value are other-than-temporary. T
his evaluation consists of several qualitative and quantitative factors regarding the severity and duration 
of the unrealized loss as well as our ability and intent to hold the investment until a forecasted recovery 
occurs. Additionally, we  46  assess whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than no
t we will be required to sell any investment before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Factors considered
 include: quoted market prices; recent financial results and operating trends; implied values from any recen
t transactions or offers of investee securities; credit quality of debt instrument issuers; other publicly a
vailable information that may affect the value of our investments; duration and severity of the decline in v
alue; and our strategy and intentions for holding the investment. Long-Lived Assets Long-lived assets, other
 than goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the ca
rrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable. Conditions that would necessitate an impairment assess
ment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset, a significant change in the e
xtent or manner in which an asset is used, or any other significant adverse change that would indicate that 
the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable. For long-lived assets used in ope
rations, impairment losses are only recorded if the asset’s carrying amount is not recoverable through its u
ndiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. We measure the impairment loss based on the difference 
between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when ce
rtain criteria are met, including when management has committed to a plan to sell the asset, the asset is av
ailable for sale in its immediate condition, and the sale is probable within one year of the reporting date.
 Assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell. Assets held for sa
le were not significant as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . Accrued Expenses and Other Included in “Accrue
d expenses and other” on our consolidated balance sheets are liabilities primarily related to leases and ass
et retirement obligations, payroll and related expenses, unredeemed gift cards, customer liabilities, curren
t debt, acquired digital media content, and other operating expenses.  As of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 ,
 our liabilities for payroll related expenses were  $2.9 billion  and  $3.4 billion  and our liabilities for
 unredeemed gift cards were  $3.0 billion  and  $2.8 billion . We reduce the liability for a gift card when 
redeemed by a customer. The portion of gift cards that we do not expect to be redeemed is recognized based o
n customer usage patterns. Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue is recorded when payments are received or due i
n advance of performing our service obligations and is recognized over the service period. Unearned revenue 
primarily relates to prepayments of AWS services and Amazon Prime memberships. Our total unearned revenue as
 of  December 31, 2017  was  $6.1 billion , of which  $5.3 billion  was recognized as revenue during the  ye
ar ended December 31, 2018 , including adjustments related to the new revenue recognition guidance. Included
 in “Other long-term liabilities” on our consolidated balance sheets was  $1.0 billion  and  $1.4 billion  o
f unearned revenue as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 .  Additionally, we have performance obligations, pri
marily related to AWS, associated with commitments in customer contracts for future services that have not y
et been recognized in our financial statements. For contracts with original terms that exceed one year, thos
e commitments not yet recognized were  $19.3 billion  as of  December 31, 2018 . The weighted average remain
ing life of our long-term contracts is  3.3  years. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is
 largely driven by customer usage, which can extend beyond the original contractual term. Foreign Currency W
e have internationally-focused stores for which the net sales generated, as well as most of the related expe
nses directly incurred from those operations, are denominated in local functional currencies. The functional
 currency of our subsidiaries that either operate or support these stores is generally the same as the local
 currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. Dollars at period-end forei
gn exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are translated at average rates prevailing throughout the perio
d. Translation adjustments are included in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” a separate component of s
tockholders’ equity, and in the “Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents,” on our consolidated 
statements of cash flows. Transaction gains and losses including intercompany transactions denominated in a 
currency other than the functional currency of the entity involved are included in “Other income (expense), 
net” on our consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the settlement and remeasurement of in
tercompany balances, we recorded gains (losses) of  $62 million ,  $202 million , and  $(186) million  in  2
016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . 47  Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted In May 2014, the Financial Accounti
ng Standards Board (“FASB”) issued an Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) amending revenue recognition guida
nce and requiring more detailed disclosures to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature
, amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. We adopte
d this ASU on January 1, 2018 for all revenue contracts with our customers using the modified retrospective 
approach and increased retained earnings by approximately  $650 million . The adjustment primarily relates t
o the unredeemed portion of our gift cards, which are now recognized over the expected customer usage period
 rather than waiting until gift cards expire or when the likelihood of redemption becomes remote. We changed
 the recognition and classification of Amazon Prime memberships, which are now accounted for as a single per
formance obligation and recognized ratably over the membership period as service sales. Previously, Prime me
mberships were considered to be arrangements with multiple deliverables and were allocated among product sal
es and service sales. Other changes relate primarily to the presentation of revenue. Certain advertising ser
vices are now classified as revenue rather than a reduction in cost of sales, and sales of apps, in-app cont
ent, and certain digital media content are presented on a net basis. Prior year amounts have not been adjust
ed and continue to be reported in accordance with our historic accounting policy. The impact of applying thi
s ASU for the  year ended December 31, 2018  primarily resulted in a decrease in product sales and an increa
se in service sales driven by the reclassification of Prime membership fees of approximately  $3.8 billion .
 Service sales also increased by approximately  $3.0 billion  for the  year ended December 31, 2018  due to 
the reclassification of certain advertising services. In January 2016, the FASB issued an ASU that updates c
ertain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments. Under thi
s ASU, certain equity investments are measured at fair value with changes recognized in net income. We adopt
ed this ASU in Q1 2018 with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, th
e FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for income taxes. The new guidance requires the recognition of 
the income tax consequences of an intercompany asset transfer, other than transfers of inventory, when the t
ransfer occurs. For intercompany transfers of inventory, the income tax effects will continue to be deferred
 until the inventory has been sold to a third party. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 with an increase of appr
oximately  $250 million  to retained earnings and deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances.  In Novem
ber 2016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the presentation of restricted cash within the consolidated statem
ents of cash flows. The new guidance requires that restricted cash be added to cash and cash equivalents on 
the consolidated statements of cash flows. We adopted this ASU in Q1 2018 on a retrospective basis with the 
following impacts to our consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):  Year Ended December 31, 2016 
Previously Reported   Adjustments   As Revised Operating activities $ 17,272    $ (69 )   $ 17,203  Investin

 and restricted cash  $ 475    $ 734    $ 1,209  48  Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2
016, the FASB issued an ASU amending the accounting for leases. The new guidance requires the recognition of
 lease assets and liabilities for operating leases with terms of more than 12 months, in addition to those c
urrently recorded, on our consolidated balance sheets. Presentation of leases within the consolidated statem
ents of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows will be generally consistent with the current l
ease accounting guidance. The ASU is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with
 early adoption permitted. We will adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 with an immaterial cumulative adjustmen
t to retained earnings rather than retrospectively adjusting prior periods. This adoption approach will resu
lt in a balance sheet presentation that will not be comparable to the prior period in the first year of adop
tion. The adoption of this ASU will result in the recognition of operating lease assets and liabilities of a
pproximately  $21 billion , which includes the reclassification of finance leases to operating leases of app
roximately  $1.2 billion , and the derecognition of build-to-suit lease assets and liabilities when we do no
t control the building during the construction period of approximately  $1.5 billion . Note 2 — CASH, CASH E
QUIVALENTS, RESTRICTED CASH, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES As of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , our cash, cash 
equivalents, restricted cash, and marketable securities primarily consisted of cash, AAA-rated money market 
funds, U.S. and foreign government and agency securities, and other investment grade securities. Cash equiva

quipment and total accumulated depreciation and amortization to include all property and equipment in servic
e, including equipment which is fully-depreciated, to conform to the current year presentation. Total proper
ty and equipment, net remains unchanged for the prior year. Depreciation expense on property and equipment w
as  $6.4 billion ,  $8.8 billion , and  $12.1 billion  which includes amortization of property and equipment
 acquired under capital leases of  $3.8 billion ,  $5.4 billion , and  $7.3 billion  for  2016 ,  2017 , and
  2018 . Gross assets recorded under capital leases were  $26.4 billion  and  $36.1 billion  as of  December
 31, 2017  and  2018 . Accumulated amortization associated with capital leases was  $13.4 billion  and  $19.
8 billion  as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . We capitalize construction in progress and record a corresp
onding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered the owner, for account
ing purposes, during the construction period. For buildings under build-to-suit lease arrangements where we 
have taken occupancy, which do not qualify for sales recognition under the sale-leaseback accounting guidanc
e, we determined that we continue to be the deemed owner of these buildings. This is principally due to our 
significant investment in tenant improvements. As a result, the buildings are being depreciated over the sho
rter of their useful lives or the related leases’ terms. Additionally, certain build-to-suit lease arrangeme
nts and finance leases provide purchase options. Upon occupancy, the long-term construction obligations are 
considered long-term finance lease obligations with amounts payable during the next 12 months recorded as “A
ccrued expenses and other.” Gross assets remaining under finance leases were  $5.4 billion  and   as of  Dec
ember 31, 2017  and  2018 . Accumulated amortization associated with finance leases was  $635 million  and  
$1.1 billion  as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . As disclosed in “Note 1 — Description of Business and Ac
counting Policies,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on January 1, 2019. Note
 4 — ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL, AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS 2016 Acquisition Activity  During  2016 , we acq
uired certain companies for an aggregate purchase price of  $103 million . The primary reason for these acqu
isitions, none of which were individually material to our consolidated financial statements, was to acquire 
technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 51  2017 Acquisition Activit
y  On  May 12, 2017 , we acquired Souq Group Ltd. (“Souq”), an e-commerce company, for approximately  $583 m
illion , net of cash acquired, and on August 28, 2017, we acquired Whole Foods Market, a grocery store chain
, for approximately  $13.2 billion , net of cash acquired. Both acquisitions are intended to expand our reta
il presence. During  2017 , we also acquired certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of  $20
4 million . The primary reason for our other  2017  acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to
 enable Amazon to serve customers more effectively. 2018 Acquisition Activity On  April 12, 2018 , we acquir
ed Ring Inc. (“Ring”) for cash consideration of approximately  $839 million , net of cash acquired, and on  
September 11, 2018 , we acquired PillPack, Inc. (“PillPack”) for cash consideration of approximately  $753 m
illion , net of cash acquired, to expand our product and service offerings. During  2018 , we also acquired 
certain other companies for an aggregate purchase price of  $57 million . The primary reason for our other  
2018  acquisitions was to acquire technologies and know-how to enable Amazon to serve customers more effecti
vely.  Acquisition-related costs were expensed as incurred and were not significant.  Pro forma results of o
perations have not been presented because the effects of these acquisitions, individually and in the aggrega

angible assets acquired primarily by using the income approach. These assets are included within “Other asse
ts” on our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized to operating expenses on a straight-line basi
s over their estimated useful lives. 52  Goodwill The goodwill of the acquired companies is primarily relate
d to expected improvements in technology performance and functionality, as well as sales growth from future 
product and service offerings and new customers, together with certain intangible assets that do not qualify

2017 in exchange for notes assumed in connection with the acquisition of Whole Foods Market and  $128 millio
n  of 2025 Notes issued by Whole Foods Market that did not participate in our December 2017 exchange offer. 
The effective interest rate of the 2025 Notes was  3.02% . Interest on the Notes issued in 2012 is payable  
semi-annually in arrears in May and November . Interest on the Notes issued in 2014 is payable  semi-annuall
y in arrears in June and December . Interest on the Notes issued in 2017 is payable semi-annually in arrears
 in February and August. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears in June and December
. We may redeem the Notes at any time in whole, or from time to time, in part at specified redemption prices
. We are not subject to any financial covenants under the Notes. The proceeds from the November 2012 and the
 December 2014 Notes were used for general corporate purposes. The proceeds from the August 2017 Notes were 
used to fund the consideration for the acquisition of Whole Foods Market, to repay notes due in 2017, and fo
r general corporate purposes. The estimated fair value of the Notes was approximately  $25.7 billion  and  $
24.3 billion  as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , which is based on quoted prices for our debt as of those
 dates. In October 2016, we entered into a  $500 million  secured revolving credit facility with a lender th
at is  secured by certain seller receivables , which we subsequently increased to  $620 million  and may fro
m time to time increase in the future subject to lender approval (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facilit
y is available for a term of  three years , bears interest at the London interbank offered rate (“ LIBOR ”) 
plus  1.65% , and has a commitment fee of  0.50%  on the undrawn portion. There were  $592 million  and  $59
4 million  of borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , which h
ad a weighted-average interest rate of  2.7%  and  3.2%  as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . As of  Decemb
er 31, 2017  and  2018 , we  54  have pledged  $686 million  of our cash and seller receivables as collatera
l for debt related to our Credit Facility. The estimated fair value of the Credit Facility, which is based o
n Level 2 inputs, approximated its carrying value as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . The other debt, incl
uding the current portion, had a weighted-average interest rate of  5.8%  and  6.0%  as of  December 31, 201
7  and  2018 . We used the net proceeds from the issuance of this debt primarily to fund certain business op
erations. The estimated fair value of the other long-term debt, which is based on Level 2 inputs, approximat
ed its carrying value as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . As of  December 31, 2018 , future principal paym
ents for our total debt were as follows (in millions):   Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 1,371  2020 1,298  2
021 1,016  2022 1,266  2023 1,014  Thereafter 19,000    $ 24,965  In April 2018, we established a commercial
 paper program (the “Commercial Paper Program”) under which we may from time to time issue unsecured commerc
ial paper up to a total of  $7.0 billion  at any time, with individual maturities that may vary but will not
 exceed  397 days  from the date of issue. There were  no  borrowings outstanding under the Commercial Paper
 Program as of  December 31, 2018 .  In April 2018, in connection with our Commercial Paper Program, we amen
ded and restated our unsecured revolving credit facility (the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of lender
s to increase our borrowing capacity thereunder to  $7.0 billion . As amended and restated, the Credit Agree
ment has a term of  three years , but it may be extended for up to  three  additional  one -year terms if ap
proved by the lenders. The interest rate applicable to outstanding balances under the amended and restated C
redit Agreement is  LIBOR  plus  0.50% , with a commitment fee of  0.04%  on the undrawn portion of the cred
it facility. There were  no  borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of  December 31, 2017  and
  2018 . Note 6 — OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES Our other long-term liabilities are summarized as follows (in

are as follows (in millions):   December 31, 2018 Gross capital lease obligations $ 17,952  Less imputed int
erest (582 ) Present value of net minimum lease payments 17,370  Less current portion of capital lease oblig
ations (7,720 ) Total long-term capital lease obligations $ 9,650  55  We continue to be the deemed owner af

and record a corresponding long-term liability for build-to-suit lease agreements where we are considered th
e owner during the construction period for accounting purposes. These liabilities primarily relate to our co
rporate buildings and fulfillment, sortation, delivery, and data centers. As disclosed in “Note 1 — Descript
ion of Business and Accounting Policies,” our accounting for build-to-suit and finance leases will change on
 January 1, 2019. Tax Contingencies We have recorded reserves for tax contingencies, inclusive of accrued in
terest and penalties, for U.S. and foreign income taxes. These reserves primarily relate to transfer pricing
 and state income taxes, and are presented net of offsetting deferred tax assets related to net operating lo
sses and tax credits. See “Note 9 — Income Taxes” for discussion of tax contingencies. 56  Note 7 — COMMITME
NTS AND CONTINGENCIES Commitments We have entered into non-cancellable operating, capital, and finance lease

7 billion  are recorded within “Accrued expenses and other” as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , and  $8.4 
billion  and  $9.6 billion  are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of  December 31, 2017  and 
 2018 . (2) Excluding interest, current finance lease obligations of  $282 million  and  $411 million  are r

.6 billion  are recorded within “Other long-term liabilities” as of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 . (3) Incl
udes unconditional purchase obligations related to certain products offered in our Whole Foods Market stores
 and long-term agreements to acquire and license digital media content that are not reflected on the consoli
dated balance sheets. For those digital media content agreements with variable terms, we do not estimate the
 total obligation beyond any minimum quantities and/or pricing as of the reporting date. Purchase obligation
s associated with renewal provisions solely at the option of the content provider are included to the extent
 such commitments are fixed or a minimum amount is specified. (4) Includes the estimated timing and amounts 
of payments for rent and tenant improvements associated with build-to-suit lease arrangements and equipment 
lease arrangements that have not been placed in service and digital media content liabilities associated wit
h long-term digital media content assets with initial terms greater than one year. (5) Excludes approximatel
y  $3.4 billion  of accrued tax contingencies for which we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the
 amount and period of payment, if any. Pledged Assets As of  December 31, 2017  and  2018 , we have pledged 
or otherwise restricted  $1.4 billion  and  $575 million  of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable secu
rities, and certain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party 
sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby and trade letters of credit.  Suppliers During  2018 , n
o vendor accounted for 10% or more of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrange
ments with our vendors to guarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms, or the extens
ion of credit limits. Other Contingencies In 2016, we determined that we processed and delivered orders of c
onsumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by the Iran Threat Reduct
ion and Syria Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer produc
ts included books, music, other media, apparel, home and kitchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consum
er electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Our review is ongoing and we hav
e voluntarily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Cont
rol and the United States Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate f
ully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result in the imposition of penalties. For ad
ditional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of t
he Exchange Act.” 57  We are subject to claims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added
, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions in which we already collect and remit
 such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subjec
t to significant additional tax liabilities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued a
n assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period from January 2016 to March 2016, including i
nterest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on trans
actions by our third-party sellers. We believe the assessment is without merit. If South Carolina or other s
tates were successfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significa
nt additional tax liabilities. We intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. Legal Proceedings Th
e Company is involved from time to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following: In 
November 2007, an Austrian copyright collection society, Austro-Mechana, filed lawsuits against Amazon.com I
nternational Sales, Inc., Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon.de GmbH, Amazon.com GmbH, and Amazon Logistik in the Co
mmercial Court of Vienna, Austria and in the District Court of Munich, Germany seeking to collect a tariff o
n blank digital media sold by our EU-based retail websites to customers located in Austria. In July 2008, th
e German court stayed the German case pending a final decision in the Austrian case. In July 2010, the Austr
ian court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and ordered us to report all sales of products to which the tarif
f potentially applies for a determination of damages. We contested Austro-Mechana’s claim and in September 2
010 commenced an appeal in the Commercial Court of Vienna. We lost this appeal and in March 2011 commenced a
n appeal in the Supreme Court of Austria. In October 2011, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case to t
he European Court of Justice (“ECJ”). In July 2013, the ECJ ruled that EU law does not preclude application 
of the tariff where certain conditions are met and directed the case back to the Austrian Supreme Court for 
further proceedings. In October 2013, the Austrian Supreme Court referred the case back to the Commercial Co
urt of Vienna for further fact finding to determine whether the tariff on blank digital media meets the cond
itions set by the ECJ. In August 2015, the Commercial Court of Vienna ruled that the Austrian tariff regime 
does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and dismissed Austro-Mechana’s claims. In September 2015, Austro-Me
chana appealed that judgment to the Higher Commercial Court of Vienna. In December 2015, the Higher Commerci
al Court of Vienna confirmed that the Austrian tariff regime does not meet the conditions the ECJ set and di
smissed Austro-Mechana’s appeal. In February 2016, Austro-Mechana appealed that judgment to the Austrian Sup
reme Court. In March 2017, the Austrian Supreme Court ruled in favor of Austro-Mechana and referred the case
 back to the Commercial Court of Vienna for further proceedings. A number of additional actions have been fi
led making similar allegations. In December 2012, a German copyright collection society, Zentralstelle für p
rivate Überspielungsrechte (“ZPU”), filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l., Amazon Media EU S.à r.l., 
Amazon Services Europe S.à r.l., Amazon Payments Europe SCA, Amazon Europe Holding Technologies SCS, and Ama
zon Eurasia Holdings S.à r.l. in the District Court of Luxembourg seeking to collect a tariff on blank digit
al media sold by the Amazon.de retail website to customers located in Germany. In January 2013, a Belgian co
pyright collection society, AUVIBEL, filed a complaint against Amazon EU S.à r.l. in the Court of First Inst
ance of Brussels, Belgium, seeking to collect a tariff on blank digital media sold by the Amazon.fr retail w
ebsite to customers located in Belgium. In November 2013, the Belgian court ruled in favor of AUVIBEL and or
dered us to report all sales of products to which the tariff potentially applies for a determination of dama
ges. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. Be
ginning in August 2013, a number of complaints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc
. and several of its subsidiaries failed to compensate hourly workers for time spent waiting in security lin
es and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August 2013, Busk v. I
ntegrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the
 District of Nevada, and Vance v. Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., another affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., 
and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky.
 In September 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the Unit
ed States District Court for the Western District of Washington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affi
liate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky
. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solut
ions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiff
s variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and former employees under the Fair L
abor Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states incl
uding Arizona, California, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Washington, and Nevada, and  one  complai
nt asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. The complaints seek an unspecified am
ount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other simil
ar cases. In December 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that time spent waiting for and undergoing secur
ity screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage and hour statute. In February 2015, the
 courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions
 without prejudice. In March 2016, the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dis
missed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealed the district court’s judgment t
o the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of  58  appeals affir
med the district court’s decision. In June 2017, the United States District Court for the Western District o
f Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases with prejudice. We dispute any remaining allegations of wron
gdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters. In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed a com
plaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services, LLC fo
r patent infringement in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint a

Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled “System and Method for Maintaining N Number of Simult
aneous Cryptographic Sessions Using a Distributed Computing Environment.” The complaint seeks injunctive rel
ief, an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 20
16, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In 
June 2016, the case was stayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the United States Paten
t and Trademark Office. In January 2019, the stay of the case was lifted following resolution of the review 
petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.
 In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, Inc. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States 
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that the use of
 “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringes U.S.
 Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hypermedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking Externa
l Application Providing Interaction and Display of Embedded Objects Within A Hypermedia Document.” The compl
aint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. In February 2016, Eolas file
d an amended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eola
s alleged in its damages report that in the event of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to  $130
 - $250 million  in damages. In April 2017, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for
 the Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselve
s vigorously in this matter. In October 2017, SRC Labs, LLC and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe filed a complaint f
or patent infringement against Amazon Web Services, Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., and VADATA, Inc. in the United S
tates District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, that c

eb site access and processing utilizing a computer system incorporating reconfigurable processors operating 
under a single operating system image”; 7,149,867, entitled “System and method of enhancing efficiency and u
tilization of memory bandwidth in reconfigurable hardware”; 7,225,324 and 7,620,800, both entitled “Multi-ad
aptive processing systems and techniques for enhancing parallelism and performance of computational function
s”; and 9,153,311, entitled “System and method for retaining DRAM data when reprogramming reconfigurable dev
ices with DRAM memory controllers.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, 
interest, and a compulsory on-going royalty. In February 2018, the Virginia district court transferred the c
ase to the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington. In November 2018, the case w
as stayed pending resolution of eight review petitions filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Off
ice relating to the ‘324, ‘867, and ‘311 patents. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to def
end ourselves vigorously in this matter. In May 2018, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and CF Dynamic Advanc
es LLC filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Northern Distr
ict of New York. The complaint alleges, among other things, that “Alexa Voice Software and Alexa enabled dev

ications.” The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of damages, enhanced damages, attorneys’ fees, costs, a
nd interest. In November 2018, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Northern
 District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
in this matter. 59  In November 2018, Dynamic Data Technologies, LLC filed a complaint for patent infringeme
nt against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Digital Services, LLC in the United State
s District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges, among other things, that products
 and services with H.265 functionality, including Amazon Elastic Transcoder, AWS Elemental Media Convert, AW
S Elemental MediaLive, certain EC2 instances, Amazon CloudFront, Amazon Fire TV, and Amazon Fire tablets, in
fringe U.S. Patent Nos. 8,135,073, entitled “Enhancing Video Images Depending On Prior Image Enhancements”;

  , there was  $6.6 billion  of net unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock-based compensat
ion arrangements. This compensation is recognized on an accelerated basis with approximately  half  of the c
ompensation expected to be expensed in the next twelve months, and has a weighted-average recognition period
 of  1.1  years. The estimated forfeiture rate as of  December 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  was  28% ,  28%
 , and  27% . Changes in our estimates and assumptions relating to forfeitures may cause us to realize mater
ial changes in stock-based compensation expense in the future.  During  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , the fair 
value of restricted stock units that vested was  $4.3 billion ,  $6.8 billion , and  $11.4 billion . Common 
Stock Available for Future Issuance As of  December 31, 2018 , common stock available for future issuance to
 employees is  113 million  shares. 61  Note 9 — INCOME TAXES In  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 , we recorded net
 tax provisions of  $1.4 billion ,  $769 million , and  $1.2 billion . We have tax benefits relating to exce
ss stock-based compensation deductions and accelerated depreciation deductions that are being utilized to re
duce our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were  $412 million ,  $957 million , and  $1.
2 billion  for  2016 ,  2017 , and  2018 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.
S. Tax Act significantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the statutor
y corporate tax rate from  35%  to  21% , eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax 
on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, introducing new tax regimes, and changing how foreign earni
ngs are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended the option to claim accelerated dep
reciation deductions by allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We
 reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. Tax Act and recorded provisional amounts in our financial stat
ements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. Tax Act of 
approximately  $789 million . This amount was primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferr
ed tax liabilities resulting from the permanent reduction in the U.S. statutory corporate tax rate to  21%  
from  35% , after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of our foreign 
subsidiaries. The amount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of t
he accounting implications of the U.S. Tax Act. The components of the provision for income taxes, net are as

y rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018. (2) Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and beginning
 in 2017, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. For 2017 and 2018, our tax provision includes  
$1.3 billion  and  $1.6 billion  of excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our provision for inc
ome taxes in 2017 was lower than in 2016 primarily due to excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation 
and the one-time favorable effect of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by an increase in the proportion of 
foreign losses for which we may not realize a tax benefit and audit-related developments. We regularly asses
s whether it is more likely than not that we will realize our deferred tax assets in each taxing jurisdictio
n in which we operate. In performing this assessment with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all availa
ble evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations of future earnings, capital gains
, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes,
 and other relevant factors. In Q2 2017, we recognized an estimated charge to tax expense of  $600 million  
to record a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets in Luxembourg. Our provision for income 
taxes in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time p
rovisional tax benefit of the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was partially offset by the reduction to
 the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion of foreign losses for which we may
 not realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Certain for
eign subsidiary earnings are subject to U.S. taxation under the U.S. Tax Act, which also repeals U.S. taxati
on on the subsequent repatriation of those earnings. We intend to invest substantially all of our foreign su
bsidiary earnings, as well as our capital in our foreign subsidiaries, indefinitely outside of the U.S. in t
hose jurisdictions in which we would incur significant, additional costs upon repatriation of such amounts.

, 2018 , our federal, foreign, and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were appro
ximately  $627 million ,  $7.8 billion , and  $919 million . The federal, foreign, and state net operating l
oss carryforwards are subject to limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code and applicable f
oreign and state tax law. If not utilized, a portion of the federal, foreign, and state net operating loss c
arryforwards will begin to expire in  2029 ,  2019 , and  2019 , respectively. As of  December 31, 2018 , ou
r tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were approximately  $1.7 billion . If not utilized, a por
tion of the tax credit carryforwards will begin to expire in  2022 . As of  December 31, 2018 , our federal 
capital loss carryforwards for income tax purposes was approximately  $261 million . If not utilized, a port
ion of the capital loss carryforwards will begin to expire in  2022 . Tax Contingencies We are subject to in
come taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is requi
red in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary cour
se of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is unc
ertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to
 which, additional taxes will be due. These reserves are established when we believe that certain positions 
might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. We adjust these 
reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for 
income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropria
te. 64  The reconciliation of our tax contingencies is as follows (in millions):   December 31,   2016   201

________ (1) As of  December 31, 2018 , we had approximately  $3.4 billion  of accrued tax contingencies, of
 which  $1.7 billion , if fully recognized, would decrease our effective tax rate. As of  December 31, 2017 
 and  2018 , we had accrued interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, related to tax contin
gencies of  $107 million  and  $127 million . Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, rec
ognized for the years ended  December 31, 2016 ,  2017 , and  2018  was  $9 million ,  $40 million , and  $2
0 million .  These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes
 or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. As previ
ously disclosed, we have received Notices of Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS for transactions und
ertaken in the 2005 and 2006 calendar years relating to transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries. The 
IRS is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income by an amount that would result in additional federal tax 
of approximately  $1.5 billion , subject to interest. On March 23, 2017, the U.S. Tax Court issued its decis
ion regarding the issues raised in the IRS NOPAs. The Tax Court rejected the approach from the IRS NOPAs in 
determining transfer pricing adjustments in 2005 and 2006 for the transactions undertaken with our foreign s
ubsidiaries and adopted, with adjustments, our suggested approach. In September 2017, the IRS appealed the d
ecision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously 
in this matter. If the Tax Court decision were reversed on appeal or if the IRS were to successfully assert 
transfer pricing adjustments of a similar nature to the NOPAs for transactions in subsequent years, we could
 be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.  In October 2014, the European Commission opened a fo
rmal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corp
orate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid.  On Octo
ber 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Lu
xembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commissi
on announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately  €250 million , plus interest, for the period May
 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional
 taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Com
mission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of
 all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appe
aled. We believe the European Commission’s decision to be without merit and will continue to defend ourselve
s vigorously in this matter.  We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdicti
ons including China, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom.  We are under, or may be sub
ject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these par
ticular jurisdictions primarily for  2008  and thereafter. We expect the total amount of tax contingencies w
ill grow in  2019 . In addition, changes in state, federal, and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contin
gencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultima
tely paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amount
s accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will receive additional assessments b
y various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax examinations in one or more jurisdictio
ns. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on ta
x filings in years through  2018 . The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the
 ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of poss
ible outcomes. Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION We have organized our operations into  three  segments: North A
merica, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses “Fulfillment,” “Market
ing,” “Technology and content,” and “General and administrative” based  65  on usage, which is generally ref
lected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are a
llocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology cost
s are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue tra
nsactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker
 evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages its operations. The North America segment primaril
y consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptio
ns through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these o
nline stores. The International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer p
roducts (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segme
nt includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these
 online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North Ameri
ca-focused online stores. The AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, 
database, and other service offerings for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institut
ions. Information on reportable segments and reconciliation to consolidated net income (loss) is as follows

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures  We carried out an evaluation required by the Securities Ex
change Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of our principal execu
tive officer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclo
sure controls and procedures, as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of  December 31, 2018 . Based
 on this evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that, as of  
December 31, 2018 , our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance th
at information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the 1934 Act is re
corded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms a
nd to provide reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, 
including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely de
cisions regarding required disclosure. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting  Man
agement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, 
as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act. Management has assessed the effectiveness of our internal cont
rol over financial reporting as of  December 31, 2018  based on criteria established in Internal Control — I
ntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. A
s a result of this assessment, management concluded that, as of  December 31, 2018 , our internal control ov
er financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financia
l reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally a
ccepted accounting principles. Ernst & Young has independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal co
ntrol over financial reporting and its report is included below.  Changes in Internal Control Over Financial
 Reporting  There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended 
 December 31, 2018  that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal co
ntrol over financial reporting.  Limitations on Controls  Our disclosure controls and procedures and interna
l control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objective
s as specified above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or ou
r internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and fraud. Any control system, 
no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable,
 not absolute, assurance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide abs
olute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and insta
nces of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.  70    Report of Independent Registered Public
 Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders  Amazon.com, Inc.  Opinion on Internal Control Over
 Financial Reporting We have audited Amazon.com, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of  , b
ased on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsorin
g Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amazon.com,
 Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reportin
g as of  December 31, 2018 , based on the COSO criteria.  We also have audited, in accordance with the stand
ards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance shee
ts of the Company as of  December 31, 2018  and  2017 , and the related consolidated statements of operation
s, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ende
d  December 31, 2018  and the related notes and our report dated  January 31, 2019  expressed an unqualified
 opinion thereon.  Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective inter
nal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over f
inancial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Repor
ting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting
 based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be indepe
ndent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rul
es and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.  We conducted our audit in accor
dance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
 material respects.  Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial report
ing, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating eff
ectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we consid
ered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. 
 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over f
inancial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financ
ial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
 accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those polici
es and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and 
fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assura
nce that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance 
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being m
ade only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reaso
nable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of
 the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.  Because of its inheren
t limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, proj
ections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may becom
e inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedu
res may deteriorate.    /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Seattle, Washington  71

we are enhancing our processes designed to identify transactions associated with individuals and entities co
vered by the ITRA. PART III
